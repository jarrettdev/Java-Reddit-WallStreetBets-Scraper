# Java-Reddit-WallStreetBets-Scraper

## What is this?

-This is my first personal project.

-I started in October 2018

- 

-This program would: 

- Use Selenium to navigate to the infamous WallStreetBets subreddit.

- Iterate through each hot post and grab all the comments.

- Flag the comments with stock tickers in them.

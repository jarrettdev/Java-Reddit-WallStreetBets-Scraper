Options being a zero sum game is true. But, that doesn't mean call holders can't make money. If those fds do end up being in the money then whoever sold those contracts will take an equal loss to what the call buyer would gain.
********************
********************

I mean if I‚Äôm being honest I literally have zero money on AMD right now I just like the meme

********************
********************
This is some of the dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever read. If that were true max pain would have statistical validity and it has none. Fundamentally options are a zero sum game but practically they‚Äôre not. When you‚Äôre buying options you‚Äôre buying them from a market maker and that market maker immediately hedges the sale with common stock, long or short, to remain delta neutral and collect premium. They don‚Äôt care about what the stock or option does because they‚Äôre completely hedged. This is true for the vast majority of options volume. Why do you think there‚Äôs so much liquidity in the market? You think you‚Äôre actually buying your $69 MU calls from another autist in here? If you don‚Äôt make money trading options it‚Äôs not because the game is rigged, and it‚Äôs not because of ‚Äòzero sum theory‚Äô, it‚Äôs because you suck at trading options.

Intel is going to be flailing around until they moved onto a chiplet based CPU, AMD has also dropped little compared to NVDA and INTC. Maybe investors would flock to AMD if they hit out of the park until INTC pulls their head out of their ass. The Zen train won't stop any time soon. Soon Zen 3 & 4 will come out. People are so excited to upgrade from generation to generation now, with intel you had individuals up until recently waiting to upgrade from their 2500k. I'm about to upgrade from my i5-750. INTC would be in deepshit if there wasn't a replacement schedule for companies.

********************
How does hedge protect MM from stock going down? The call is hedged but the share isn't
********************
********************
********************
What do you mean? If you sell a call with a delta of, say, .57 and then you long 57 shares you‚Äôre immune to price fluctuations and collect premiums. You adjust your position as delta increases/decreases to remain delta neutral and collect premium.
********************
********************
********************
AMD still going down Tuesday. Due to broader market conditions not because the company isn‚Äôt expanding.
********************
********************

Oh. Ok.

I was almost sure my account would blow up. I was in calls, but news all weekend was bearish. Glad AMD was able to pull off a ROKU / DIS.

RIP $INTC. Their response for Computex was that binned 9900k, I bet they're feeling stupid right now. AMD needs to bundle a PCIE 4.0 SSD to lock customers into AMD's Ecosystem. Intel doesn't offer CPUs that have PCIE 4.0.

The payoff of a put and a share is the exact same as a call.

How do you figure when the call could be worth zero one day

yeah, maybe my math is wrong (I'm very rusty), but I think the payoff is only equal if you threw in a bond (with a payoff equal to the strike) on top of the call (under PCP)

WSB wrong? Say it ain't so
********************
********************
********************
Anyone who thinks AMD is priced in is a huge fucking retard. oh right this is wsb...
********************
********************
********************
There's reason to be cautious here. For all we know these CPUs might launch with an issue with temps that leads to thermal throttling unless you buy a $100+ cooler. Maybe a lot of these end up being lemons that have to be RMA'd. We dont know. The current price reflects AMD IF these CPUs actually deliver on what they're promising. If you buy in now you're just betting that they are. Remember last year when wall st had a boner for Nvidia when the 20x series GPUs were launched? A gamer could see a mile away that stock was going to collapse because everybody that actually buys the product was immediately underwhelmed by what was presented. But the stock soared over the next month until the shit hit the fan.
********************
********************
********************
For all we know these CPUs might launch with an issue with temps that leads to thermal throttling unless you buy a $100+ cooler. WAT that's... generally been the standard ironically, amd has been the exception - their stock coolers are actually quite good the power specs were revealed.
********************
********************
********************
Yeah don't these draw a bit less power than the Intel chips? I get that it isn't a fact "less power=less heat", but generally, yeah. I'm skeptical cause I haven't seen hardly any negative against it, but...I have seen no negative against it, and AMD has been closing the gap the last few years quickly.
********************
********************
********************
"less power=less heat" This statement is actually 100% true thanks to the laws of conservation of energy. TLDR: watts used by your CPU/GPU are not "consumed" but instead 100% released as heat.
********************
********************
********************
I meant in the grand scheme of the PC. Different components lead to higher ambient temps, stock coolers with different efficiencies, thermal paste with higher heat transfer. You can take more power and have less operating temp, but there are factors involved.
********************
********************
********************
I mean, no. If you take more power, then the CPU will emit that energy as heat. Unless the energy is somehow being stored somewhere everything decays into heat.
********************
********************
********************
This. It's the same story with our electrical grid. Most energy transferred across the grid is wasted and emits heat. If there was a way to store it, it would emit less heat and be substantially more efficient.
********************
********************
********************
A PE greater than 100 isn't pricing in huge expectations?
********************
********************
********************
It depends on the factors influencing EPS. If the company is heavily expanding, expenses are high, which decreases nominal EPS (which inflates PE, price per share held constant). That doesn't mean the company isn't more profitable in the future, especially when the expenses are expected to drop in the future or when the fruits of the expenses are not immediate.

it's a divergence between what the rates complex thinks of FED action and what the FED has actually done so far or promised to do. i lean on the side of the FED on this one. mkt has got it wrong unless trade war truly blows up; so far that ain't happening. and it's a tall order for trump to blow up the economy with elections coming in 2020
********************
********************
********************
I'm inverting this. Fed has always been too little too late. Trump may have actually gotten it right by telling to feel the market.
********************
********************
********************
Actually they need to "blow it up" now, so they can lower the market for everyone to jump in again, and buy the dip they will create, so it will push higher and then much closer to the election they will pump and pump and it will blow past SPY 290+ easily
********************

yeah it's tall order but if anyone could do it, it would be Trump

Yes, didn't say now is recession time. Also in 07/08 it went in and out from inversion to normal multiple times. My reading is it's a warning to the fed to cut interest rates to push down the short duration bonds.

BABA is one of about two Chinese companies I‚Äôm willing to own. I can actually verify that BABA has a actual product that currently exists, so that helps a lot.

good job taking temp from borrow rate. what's the float on this thing ?
********************
********************
********************
Officially not reported but with the greenshoe from the IPO its likely about 10m shares. So ripe for a squeeze since the float is tiny and this is a popular investment theme and the only publicly traded pure-play in the space. They IPOd early May and the May 15th short figures were about 3.9m shares. But since then it might have gone up (naked short report has short volume at 60% of the traded shares, but that seems high). Likely the shorted shares are between 40-60% of the float. Lockup isn't for another 5+ months... Edited "by" to "but"
********************
********************
********************
An inevitable deal with McDonald's (MCD) will be the catalyst for the short squeeze. Jefferies in their report calculated that a deal with MCD could be worth $25 a share based on 6% capture of MCD's beef sales in the US. Once a deal is announced, this thing could pop >20% based on the fundamentals of the new revenue, and then another >20% on a short squeeze after the first pop.
********************

Is there any substance to the mcd deal rumor or no? Edit: apparently, former McDonald's CEO Donald Thompson is on the BYND board. Well that's interesting.
********************

********************
********************
They have the partnership in Germany. It's just a hope, MCD said last week they aren't prepared to make any decisions yet, though meat-less is being discussed internally.
********************
********************
********************
That would be moon-type news... I gave myself a bit of time with the August calls. But honestly that specific bit of news is probably not going to be announced by then (if it ever is...)
********************
********************
********************
mcd knows how to make a veggie burger already.
********************
********************
********************
Yeah but does it taste any good? Although since Beyond doesn't taste that great maybe it's lateral. Impossible is way better.
********************
********************
********************
lmao this thing could double once more on nothing
********************
********************
********************
Crazy, right? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been elbow deep in calls. Long term this is garbage- but short term I think this has the potential to moon on float/short fundamentals.
********************
********************
********************
it reminds me a lot of tilray. i d go cash long on this one and avoid options though. vol must be too high for options to be interesting unless u absolutely need the leverage.
********************
********************
********************
I could see Beyond Meat becoming really popular, but even as I‚Äôm posting this comment, the food giants are already developing their own plant based meats, and 9/10 they‚Äôre gonna taste better. So what percentage of that 100b market share will BYND hold when the major companies who shit money enter the market. I could see this dropping hard once Tyson food reveals there meat or another organic company comes into play.
********************
********************
********************
Forget about long term stuff- in the long run this is a commoditized product in an industry with razor thin margins. Long term this is a bad hold. This is strictly a short term trade based on the shareholder structure: float, short interest, borrow rate, lockup, etc.
********************
********************
********************
I can‚Äôt see Tyson doing meatless and it going over well. They are a hated organization for the way they treat animals. Vegans won‚Äôt buy from them.
********************
********************
********************
All the more reason to rebrand
********************
********************
********************
Tyson won't have any ready until the fall at the very earliest. I think around then is when the lockup is over as well. Could be some potentially good gains as long as the upcoming ER holds up and you're out of your position by the end of summer
********************
********************
********************
Idk. I find it hard to believe that it‚Äôs going to blow up this summer especially considering when doing a taste test it doesn‚Äôt stack up with actual meat and one guy on here stated he tried a competitors fake meat and it tasted better than BYND‚Äôs. Of course that‚Äôs anecdotal and subjective so who knows I want to try it out for myself as a meat lover.
********************
********************
********************
Doesnt have to blow up to make money but I think a lot is pending their upcoming ER. If you watch the price action, it fluctuates well for daytrades. Catch a good swing with enough calls and you could pull in a good sum relative to your capital.
********************
********************
********************
Makes sense, I hope people do make some good coin off this. I won‚Äôt be participating though just because I can never monitor it 24/7.
********************
********************
********************
Fake price targets, fake hype, fake news, fake meat. Only play is to short the fuck out of BYND until it dies but puts are so expensive and nobody will lend shares. Best play is to not play at all.

That is an interesting counter point. I don't know, they look to me like they are turning into Europe's Argentina, but I'll admit, anything could happen there even an EU bailout.
********************
********************
********************
EU banks are so invested in Turkey that if anything happens over there then they will be massively exposed. BBVA which is the second largest financial entity in Spain owns the most shares in Turkeys largest bank which is Granti. Outside of that Deutsche Bank underwrote and invested in a lot of Turkish mortgages and loans. Since the IMF reformation of the early 2000's Turkish banking sector has opened up completely to foreign investment and basically recovered all their 2008 losses just one year later thanks to diversification. Erdogan has elections coming up in 2023 I think if the current candidate for Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu wins Istanbul again on the 23rd of next month then he will make a run for president and unseat Erdogan. His insanity is the primary reason for the fall of the economy due to his insistence on meddling in the affairs of the central bank. If Imamolgu wins Turkish stocks are a buy if he looses they are garbage.

You can‚Äôt buy the Tesla 2025 bonds because they are 144a and only for qualified investors (not retail). I tried getting ahold of these with thoughts they‚Äôd issue equity and make good on them but retail buyers cannot buy these.
********************
********************
********************
Welp :(
********************
********************
********************
Yes, if you‚Äôre in the US, for the 144A note, you will have to be a QIB (which is slightly different than a qualified investor). If there is an offshore component, as a Reg S note, and you‚Äôre outside the US, with limited exceptions, you could buy the bond subject to the minimum denom which is likely to be 100k.

if anyone questions this just shout ryzen 3000 and affordability at them repeatedly. seriously though it's gonna take intel dropping the retail value of their processors to compete with the new lineup. right now there's zero reason to go intel over amd. even if the chips were priced similarly it's a toss-up
********************
********************
********************
Something is going on over there at amd. This was personally evident for me when I did a deep dive on which high end laptop I was going to buy. Ryzen clearly was a dominant chip. Su bae is a beast.
********************
********************
********************
In Q3 2015, intel sold me a 14nm skylake processor. Back then, this was a completely new architecture built on a brand new 14nm node. Today, they are selling skylake+++ built on 14nm++++. Their 10nm node, if on schedule, will yet again be skylake. If their 10nm implodes like their 7nm did, we can expect ANOTHER 14nm skylake rehash this year. This is of course, ignoring their hyperthreading security issues. It's not that AMD is doing something special, its that intel is alternating between going backwards and doing nothing at all.
********************
********************
********************
Eh. They've increased clock speeds with each iteration. But yeah, no huge leaps. Honestly AMD has done the same thing until now.
********************
********************
********************
I don't know about this specific instance, but increasing clock speeds is often literally just changing a number and then dealing with a slightly higher chip failure rate.
********************
********************
********************
There's one guy who is basically the wunderkind of CPU development. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer) Notice how long ago Wikipedia says he joined AMD to make Zen. That's what turned AMD around since their last successful product... the Athlon, which he also made. Then he went to Tesla because they were doing the coolest shit. Now he's back at Intel, so in a few years Intel will have some shit that will spank AMD again. If you're a fundamentals fag just long whatever this guy is into.
********************
********************
********************
do we know whether or not he was a significant engineer on the ryzen 3000 series? wiki states he left four years ago & I doubt they sat on cutting edge tech for four years. I'm thinking he pioneered the zen series and someone else optimized it for affordability and performance.
********************
********************
********************
He left designs for the next 2 generations when he left. //source - someone on hacker news.
********************
********************
********************
That‚Äôs would be threadripper 1900s and ryzen 5... so no involvement with ryzen 3000
********************
********************
********************
Seems like a lot of AMD pumping going on
********************
********************
********************
Yeah ever since it was at $2.00 a couple years ago... It's been pumping real good. What AMD released on Sunday puts the final nail in intc
********************
********************
********************
Nah AMD has yet to show astronomical revenue growth similar to NVDA during NVDA's rise. AMD's progress is impressive but they have to "show us the money" first.
********************
********************
********************
really? you wait till AMD has hit a home run, then you buy shares? or should you preemptively buy shares when Babe Ruth steps up to the plate? hint Lisa is Babe. what do you think happens in a duopoly when a dominant player loses their position?
********************
********************
********************
Keep in mind that AMD gaining market share is priced in. That price isn't just based on current sale numbers.
********************
********************
********************
Taking market share by being competitive with CPUs and GPUs is priced in. Massive market share by being dominant with either CPU or GPU is not priced in.
********************
********************
********************
Everyone expects 20% datacenter marketshare at best. But if you have a clearly superior product.. you know the fastest high performance CPU on the planet! Is 20% really all AMD can muster?
********************
********************
********************
No its not? You can do some pretty light sensitivity and get way above consensus numbers
********************
********************
********************
Litteraly wait until ryzen 3000, have you even seen how well the last gen ryzen processors have been doing? This is a cold calculated move by AMD to take market share from intel
********************
********************
********************
I think the astronomical revenue growth came with the initial Zen launch. Since then further improvements have been slow and steady. Maybe we'll see another jump soon if Zen2 gets a surge of datacenter adoption.
********************
********************
********************
Intc is taking over the networking space with nfv acceleration features.
********************
********************
********************
I'm an electrical engineer working in chip design. Never worked for either Intel or AMD though. I have heard rumors for a long time that Intel is stuck in a rut and short sighted, basically stifling innovation to chase efficiency, while AMD has gotten their shit together. AMD made some terrible choices in the mid 2000s on fabrication technology choices, but Intel has lost their edge in this sense. The chiplet thing is basically the wave of the future as technology scaling stagnates. AMD right now reminds me of Nvidia 5 years ago; a lot of good new things going on that the competition isn't doing.
********************
********************
********************
Uh doesn't AMD literally send truck loads of $$$ to Linus, especially during the ryzen launch coverage as well?
********************
********************
********************
No, he‚Äôs much closely partnered with intel actually. They do sponsored giveaways and videos every few months. He talks about what a great partner they‚Äôve been in the video, and mentions that LMG won‚Äôt be investing in anything here because it may be a conflict of interest. Because of this, if he had an ulterior motive, it would make much more sense if he was downplaying the news, not talking about how big of an impact AMD will have on the tech market.

********************
********************
********************
From my personal experience of working with Chinese and American (or broadly Western) students, it's more about the boss-man being a god on Earth. And the culture of shame. If I tell the Chinese student to do something and they misunderstand, they're going to nod and try to wing it. When they fuck up, they try to do it again, afraid that someone would suspect that they're incompetent. If they think something is wrong with my instructions, I'll never know it. For I am the Boss and therefore must know better. An American would just ask me to repeat the instructions until they understood or suggest that the process could be improved somewhat. Often assuming they're smarter than they are in the process, but that's much more conductive to innovation than maintaining this incredibly rigid work structure.

That philosophy has had disastrous effects, especially in Communist China, while I don‚Äôt think the CCP will stop following this ideology I think is morbidly hilarious to see the disastrous consequences unfold. Events such as the Great Leap Forward or more recently the development of high speed rail, China partially stole Japanese High Speed technology, which created disasters like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenzhou_train_collision
********************
********************
********************
Wenzhou train collision On 23 July 2011, two high-speed trains travelling on the Yongtaiwen railway line collided on a viaduct in the suburbs of Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, People's Republic of China. The two trains derailed each other, and four cars fell off the viaduct. 40 people were killed, at least 192 were injured, 12 of which were severe injuries. Officials responded to the accident by hastily concluding rescue operations and ordering the burial of the derailed cars.

Im not going to reply to everything, but specifically in case of the mouse, Xerox sold the know-how to Jobs, albeit for very little money. Apple engineers were invited to the Xerox PARC specifically to learn from Xerox engineers and copy their technology. So the mouse was hardly stolen.

So they did business and shared technology info for eachs benefit. I was largely addressing op point that somehow all western creations are created in a vacuum. There is a huge gray area as to what constitutes as theft which even the US has trouble resolving. IP theft and knowledge sharing is not a symptom of being in China. You don't think other developing countries like Vietnam, India, Brazil or Mexico would also commit theft if businesses move there. This problem isn't something that can be cleaned overnight.

I think those were all either licensed or ideas that couldn't be patented anyway.

I'm just saying that those brilliant creations weren't created singularly and were improved from existing ideas and products. This bold strategy of using tariffs has not worked because China's plan has always been to reduce its reliance on export. Tariffs has managed to sped up this process.

Asian‚Äôs are exceptionally racist
********************
********************
********************
Indeed. I say that as an Asian immigrant to the US. Much of it has to do with less exposure to foreigners of different races in those Asian countries. South Korea, for example, has gotten far better about it as they‚Äôve been more and more open to immigration. Disdain for other, fellow Asians, though, stems less from racism, more from animosity due to historical conflicts. Well, maybe not Japan, which still flirts with the whole ‚Äúthe Japanese race is the master race‚Äù idea still. It‚Äôs part of why making amends with Japan is still difficult: because there still lies this attitude that the Imperial Japan era was the glory days. They don‚Äôt hold this apologetic attitude that Germany does for its part in WWII. Shit‚Äôs complicated, yo. TL;DR: Less exposure to and knowledge of foreigners means Asians tend to have less understanding of what can be offensive. Say what you will of the US, but we‚Äôre much farther ahead in race relations than many other developed countries (especially Asian ones) - if mainly because it‚Äôs such a hot topic here.

That's true, the carrier chooses the engine loadout and the carrier is responsible for maintenance.

Short selling does NOT affect how a company is run. Tesla is run absolutely horrible. The growth story is over and now they are raising money just to pay bills and keep the lights on.

The Model 3 is a failure; It‚Äôs too expensive and Tesla spent way too much money on it.

Theres multiple john carter squeezes ready to fire which means high volatility one way or another and its in an uptrend so most likely 5-6% upwards is not much to ask for within 3 weeks as it will revert back to the mean after that so if you at profit and dont get greedy you can ride that! But the hourly squeeze fired short today the daily is still looking like it has positive momentum as it just hit 20 day ma mean today plus the 3 day fired long and 2 day is shoring positive momentum!

With the trade war escalating week by week and Iran in focus you really think now‚Äôs the time to buy puts?

You want the VIX to be around 20-25+ minimum at a spike to have puts on $UVXY. If you buy them when UVXY is flatlining around support you're doing it wrong.
********************
********************
********************
Vix has support levels now???
********************
********************
********************
Only for people who don't understand the VIX.
********************
********************
********************
Vix was at fucking 9 a month ago when trump was pumping the trade war. The literal only thing holding vix down is volatility in the S and P 500 bc of trade. If it ever gets resolved vix will take a shit. This fucking etfs lose 4-6% per week anyway if you bag hold shares. Might as well play some vxx 27.5 puts anyway. Its really hard for it to go below 25. Vix futures contango and backwardation etc
********************
********************
********************
They aren't as liquid as I'd like them to be, way too high of a spread. Plus, the IV of UVXY is so high. You'd have to see some serious movement to be profitable.
********************
********************
********************
I think VXX is more liquid
********************
********************
********************
It works until it doesn‚Äôt
********************
********************
********************
Wait for a nice spike in vol, then buy puts...that‚Äôs my strategy lol
********************
********************
********************
What would you consider a nice spike?
********************
********************
********************
Spreads are an issue. Vol of vol is much lower on the way down in VIX, so if you are right that nothing happens the IV will crush you. If you are wrong and things go wild IV and vol of vol will spike and you will probably lose less than you should initially.
********************
********************
********************
Look at VXX Puts (much more liquid) to asymmetrically play short vol. Look at 6+ weeks out. Shorting VXX and UVXY, as much as it is a short vol trade, is more of a short contango trade long term since the product is a 30 day weighted futures play. Short vol wise, these products really don't capture the asymmetry of a true short vol trade (short UX futures or long VIX puts ) since future doesn't start to truly track VIX until about a week out from expiration.

AMD hasn‚Äôt beat Intel in well over a decade in both consumer and data center sides until now and they‚Äôre competitively pricing their gpus to put pressure on nvidia.

He‚Äôs got a big pump chance tomorrow and another one with E3... plus a lot of time for ‚Äòtrade talks good‚Äô and earnings .... I expect him to get at least a little profit. I don‚Äôt know about $60 though - they really need to show some big earnings to substantiate that kind of number.
********************
********************
********************
AMD will make me profit. I said I believe it will be around $40‚Äôs. But could possibly peak at $60. Been bullish on AMD since the first day I heard about Ryzen back when I was below $10. When the hype train came in I thought I would be around low $20‚Äôs peak at $25 and it easily soared into low $30‚Äôs. I knew a dip was coming thought it would bottom around low 20‚Äôs and it fell below $18. Like I said i think price will hit $40‚Äôs but they consistently passed my high end and low ends so if that were to happen I can see it possibly hitting $60. And I agree they would have to have at least 2 VERY STRONG earnings for a scenario where amd were to even hit $40 to happen. But I believe they can.
********************
********************
********************
I‚Äôm in AMD at a cost basis of low 7s in my IRA. So I‚Äôm with you on long term bullish. I run my IRA like Buffet mainly because I‚Äôm lazy. But the vast majority of my holdings are in Cash and short term volatility positions. presently. I‚Äôll stay that way until some things straighten out. I think you‚Äôve got a decent chance to get a return, but there‚Äôs not an insignificant risk that we see a few more dumps along the way. Said differently, IMO the probability that you are within 5% of the bottom is very low. That said the only dog I have in the hunt is running with you so again, best of luck!
********************
********************
********************
I totally agree. Especially if the trade war shit was over with. I don‚Äôt have a ton of money to invest right now but I‚Äôm long on AMD with almost half of it. I have shares and calls and sold a put as well, kinda hoping it would bottom out at 26 last week so I could amplify the bump.

How so?(genuinely asking. Still learning the particulars of options) He still has this week left, and alot of people are bullish on amd for this week. If it goes up to 27-28 won't he be able to get a decent profit come Tuesday?
********************
********************
********************
(ASSUMING AMD STOCK PRICE GOES UP TUESDAY) If stock goes to mid $27 I can see him making money if he cashes in right away I don‚Äôt see him making money on 5/31 29C if he decides to hold out. Reason being people that bought in last week and week before were probably waiting for computex announcement and will cash out if the stock soars. People buying will most likely be long on there position. That being said if it does soar I see the price struggling to trend up. Like I said the people the week before will most likely cash in. However there is the chance they don‚Äôt because there is more news at e3. Assuming they do cash in. If he doesn‚Äôt sell Tuesday on his gains theta would eat his 5/31 29c by Friday. This would also be true even if AMD price is in mid $28. So most likely he should cash in on 5/31 29c And he has time for his 5/31 28.5c to play out but I would just cash in But to answer your question if stock does gain tomorrow Tuesday is his best chance at making profit. He‚Äôs mostly like hoping AMD gains over 5% tomorrow

********************
Yea this is pretty much correct. Im very hesitant to hold anything over a day on this play. Especially if there's not a lot of movement.
********************
********************
********************
Moral of the story, weeklies are very dangerous. I was just very bullish on AMD for this announcement and went for max leverage So I went for cheap, pretty far OTM calls to get that. I'm hoping to make a little right away and then move into a longer term position. Its a dangerous bet but I only put up like 1.4K to do it, and Im not too worried about losing a sizable chunk of that. I don't believe Im kissing the money good bye like the guy before said, not too sure of his reasoning for that, but I am prepared to. So that's how I got here I guess ha.

I'm going to have to excuse my ignorance but what the hell does any of this mean? In this case, shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federally chartered corporations that dominate the secondary mortgage market, challenged actions of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) that, they claimed, had destroyed the value of their ownership interests. Specifically, they challenge the FHFA‚Äôs decision as conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to authorize payments to the Treasury to compensate the United States for the massive investments it made in the two corporations to keep them afloat during the financial crisis. One of the plaintiffs‚Äô key arguments is the assertion that the structure of the FHFA violates the constitutional principle of separation of powers because the FHFA is headed by a single director who may be removed from office by the President only for cause. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals held in the summer of 2018 that the FHFA‚Äôs structure infringes the powers of the President, though the court refused to order the relief sought by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc challenging the panel‚Äôs refusal to set aside the actions they challenge, and the FHFA also petitioned for rehearing en banc, contending that the panel had erred in holding its structure unconstitutional.¬† The court granted both petitions and ordered supplemental briefing. In its supplemental brief, the FHFA‚Äînow headed by an acting director appointed by President Trump‚Äîreversed course and conceded that the agency‚Äôs structure violates separation-of-powers principles. Public Citizen obtained leave of the Court to file a brief as amicus curiae presenting the argument that the agency‚Äôs structure is constitutional.

Nothing is priced in as the market is only 5% off from its all time highs.
********************
********************
********************
historically speaking ‚Äú5% off all time highs‚Äù Is hugely down.
********************
********************
********************
if "could" is priced in and "do" happens, it could still very very. Only if "will" is priced in, is the market reaction just very (or less). Priced in doesn't mean that the current price is reasonable for every possibility, only that the current price reflects the market's expectations for those possibilities. Unless the market is already expecting very very tariffs (does not appear so), it could very very.
********************
********************
********************
Nobody knows more about tariffs than Donald Trump
********************
********************
********************
he is tariff man afterall
********************
********************
********************
Public commentary on the latest round (Tranche 4 I believe) is slated for June 17th. The previous tariffs have gone into effect 30-35 days after public commentary, so we're looking at a go/no-go date of July 20th or so. I don't think the 25% tariff is priced in fully. The opening of the Trade War coincided with the 2018 Q4 slump that shaved 15% of value or so. Tranche 4 covers more $$$ than the previous three applications. If we see this tariff be put into place, I think we see another 8-10% pull back. Remember, July-September is when everyone is shipping in Q4 merchandise. This is Black Friday / X-Mas promotional product and the greatest percentage of quarterly sales for the year.
********************
********************
********************
So wait till mid July to make a big bet ??
********************
********************
********************
I think there's about 6-8% on the high side and 8-10% on the down side that will hit the market on the trade deals. If there's a firm deal put in place by July 15th, there's nothing stopping us from testing/breaking ATH. If Tranche 4 goes into place, the Feds aren't saving us with a rate cut and we could see the 2300s of December 18. 8/19 long strangle might make sense. A bet on volatility for end of July makes sense. I hate to bet against Trump juicing the economy, but a 25% tariff on consumer goods is a major impact that can't be tweeted away.

basically relying on the fed to keep steady with low rates until re-election at least.

It was obviously a pump, as you can see now at 1018am the 1st half of the dump.. And thus also why you Scalp the futures my soon to be future friend.. No buying options with decay or IV to just change your price when you buy the futures.. You are wise to look to the future.
********************
********************
********************
You are an excellent teacher!
********************

Don‚Äôt you mean 10:18 and 23 seconds?

But do you have a position open?
********************
********************
********************
This is not about me Useful lad, this is about how WSB can get out of the past and stop gay options, and step into the future where you can Trade at 6am to buy those dips for the pumps at the open. But soon you will see the power the future has, everyone will. Everybody wants to see how individuals have done, and that's fine, but how about what "you" can do, and will you do in the future" It's about how "you" will have a position open, my future brethren. Do not follow the old ways of anything.. The future awaits.
********************
********************
********************
you can buy high and sell low in futures too, who would tell?.
********************
********************
********************
Except with options, you lose value, with futures, you wait for it to just come on around back if you "bought too high".. With options, you will lose it all if it doesn't come around back before your options expire, and what's worse is they lose value with IV and Theta.. You can't dethrone the future.
********************
********************
********************
So .. like shares?
********************
********************
********************
Shares... but leveraged
********************
********************
********************
You got it! Just like shares! The thing you have to be aware of is the futures have settlement dates where if you were holding them long term, like over 30-60 days, then you would need to "roll-over" or just close and re-open the trade .. Otherwise yes, exactly like shares! You buy at a specific price, and then if it goes up from that price, you profit, if it goes down, you lose money, but if you hold and it goes down and up and then up, you continue to profit, unlike options which decay and IV changes their price and they expire worthless.. Here are the "settlement dates" of /ES (S&P) for example.. https://i.imgur.com/bLkcX8R.png I scalp and trade in and out of futures, so I don't hold anyway, so none of this matters, it only matters if you want to hold futures for a long period of time.. Which it would be very interesting to see anyone who held futures for longer than a month etc anyway! You'd be insanely rich I guess if you had held futures for 3 months! .. Maybe I should look into holding the futures long just for months.. haha.
********************
********************
********************
Yeah I was just joking that it's not so revolutionary. Anyway seems complicated. Why not just trade Forex then? Insane leverage, no expiration, terrific liquidity, easy shorting ...
********************
********************
********************
Well, I just don't know Forex.. Does forex change so drastically? I don't get a "feeling" about trading currencies, I don't feel it.. I feel the future. Here is the Future chart for 3 months.. Is forex like that? I mean I honestly don't know. https://i.imgur.com/gavMtuV.png
********************
********************
********************
Forex can change drastically if you pick a volatile pair and max out your leverage. How volatile your trading environment is depends only on you and is ridiculously easy to change. In fact everything about Forex trading is extremely simple. The only thing that's not simple is the trading itself, because unlike the stock market, the Forex market doesn't have an inherent bias for up or down trend.
********************
********************
********************
Ok well, sounds nice and all, but I need the PPT, Pumps and tweets and news hype and more, and I see that in the futures, so I just want to trade futures. I just can't get into forex. Does it trade 24/5 and on Sundays and can you trade forex at 3am? What's funny is there is futures on Currency already anyway..
********************
********************
********************
You can trade forex 24/5, but there are different sessions during a day with high and low liquidity and volatility. I think one of the best things about Forex is that it's not influenced by some unpredictable tweets, but only statements of central banks and governments that come at predefined times.
********************
********************
********************
Well, it sounds like another division of the Church of Futures, but futures are always liquid, you can always fill your order no matter when you want to trade and again, I'm not feeling forex. The future is the kingdom of inheritance of WSB.

Thanks, brother. Very cool of you to say. I debated the ending on this one because I want to keep them fun but I couldn‚Äôt resist the opportunity to mess around with a Buffet quote. Not sure if I pulled it off but it was fun to try. Thanks, again. Happy to hear you liked it.

Hi OP, you might not get a lot of comments but I want you to know I really appreciate these posts, always a good read. Now what I think you should do is start a website with these posts, revolved around interesting finance/business stories, and start monetising it. As an example, check out the 'Wait But Why' blog, the guy posts long-form interesting science related articles with pretty cool formatting, diagrams. You've got something going here, already a decent base of content to start. Go for it!

You miss the nuance that if he buys 1 of each number and somebody else just buys the one winning number they split it and and he gets screwed. He needed to win and win by himself
********************
********************
********************
Not if the pot was greater than $14M. If the winnings were tax free for Mendel, all he needed to do was win back more than the $7M he contributed. At $27M he could have split it 3 ways and still have been clear.

Plus he actually only spent 5m and happened to jag the right numbers anyway

Awesome story! What Mandel did isn't always possible, it depends on the size of the tickets vs the number and cost of tickets. In practice it happens as lotteries haven't been won and jackpots get huge. The podcast Planet Money did a fun episode on it where they intervier the guy. https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/10/23/659818948/episode-676-the-first-lottery-how-to-beat-the-odds

I thought I saw somewhere that ultimately Nifty Fifty did pretty well even if you bought near the peak(and held for long enough). In any case we're looking at 20x earnings for GOOG or 27x for FB, so seems a little different. AMZN has a high P/E but only because their true earnings are much higher than their economic earnings.

What's a better multiple for AMZN?

So that you can determine what? What multiple justifies its value better? I‚Äôm going to let you in on a secret. Most sell-side analysts covering Amazon are just shouting out numbers with no multiple or model in mind. Literally. Morgan Stanley‚Äôs lead analyst doesn‚Äôt even pay mind to a valuation model. He just keeps moving up his EV/Ebitda multiple to larger and larger numbers. Source: Worked for MS. Got to see all the street research.

IBM has been trash for 20 years.
********************
********************
********************
Have they? I never followed the stock but I know they pivoted to servers in the early 2000's before everyone else realized workstations and laptops were no longer a growth industry. They missed the boat on cloud but they just bought Redhat and I'd be willing to bet they'll have pretty significant growth in their cloud business as their traditional corporate customers finally start moving into it.
********************
********************

Flat stock price over 20 years, and down ~40% over the last 5 years in the biggest bull market of a generation. Yes. They are the shining star of industry. /s

Oof yeah that fall from ~2012. Right about when people started to realize AWS was going to eat everyone's lunch.

********************
********************
IBM has more employees in India than in the US. They've outsourced their brainpower to the point where it isn't the same company. They also royally messed up a few IT projects in recent memory, and in such a way where it's like: how could anybody think this was a good idea? what the heck is wrong with them? even to a casual IT observer.
********************
********************
********************
I worked in an IT dept that outsourced to IBM in 08. I stayed on for a while as a contractor. One night some shit went wrong. There was a big bridge call about it. Some IBM manager was on. I said I know what this is. I can run down to the data center right now, have it fixed in ten minutes. The manager said no. That's not your job. We use IBM process now. The fix took two days.

********************
********************
********************
I‚Äôm gonna be honest here .. the pdt rule really is nothing to stress about . You can close your position in same day 3 times a week if you really have to but let me be frank . The BIGGEST option moves (profit) happens over the course of SEVERAL days /weeks/ months or at the very least over night . Not in same one day of trading . Whenever I close out a same day trade I usually regret it cause it either starts going my way or I could of just profited more the day or two after . If you have , idk, 50k plus account and you want to DAY trade / scalp little 10-50 cent moves , then that is def something to aspire to . But also something you really cannot do on Robin Hood, ever.
********************
********************
********************
Nonono, if it weren't for PDT we'd all be rich. It's all PDT fault.
********************
********************
********************
You‚Äôre very right, people here make all the jokes and memes about weeklies but in reality we need time for our trades to play out.
********************
********************
********************
Not true- at the very least your statement is misleading. It depends on what your strategy is, what you trade, how many contracts, what the current environment is, etc. I could flip what you said and make it ‚Äúthe biggest options moves (LOSSES) happen over the course of several days...‚Äù I scalp weekly options- more leverage at less cost than common. I very rarely hold overnight but trade when I think I can make at least 1-2 dollar moves in the contracts intraday. A $2 move on 100 contracts over the course of say a 30min to hour long hold = $20k. If you‚Äôre experienced at reading price action those moves are not that hard to come by. You‚Äôre likely not going to get the contract to move $10 intraday though so, sure, the moves in underlying price can be bigger over a long period of time obviously- but you can also get gapped significantly overnight everyday of the trade and have the contracts lose a ton of value. The longer the hold the bigger your risk, and with options, the longer the hold the bigger the move you need towards the end of the trade (time decay).
********************
********************
********************
I‚Äôm not gonna argue for he sake of arguing good luck with your own strategy. Point is. Many people vie for the opportunity to ‚Äúday trade‚Äù several times in one day or everyday with options- what I see more often then not is (robinhood users) that really doesn‚Äôt help them become more profitable .
********************
********************
********************
You cant control your $ when the market is closed. Swing trading options is how you can more easily blow up your account.
********************
********************
********************
Not trying to argue and I wasn‚Äôt advocating for my strategy over others just saying your statement about profit was misleading. I agree most people do not know how to trade profitably intraday and/or don‚Äôt have the discipline/experience to only take high probability opportunities.
********************
********************
********************
I completely agree. However, the high volatility strategy I'm trading are just 15-40 minute scalps once or twice a day. That's why I need to be above PDT restrictions.
********************
********************
********************
Scalping on robinhood ? Dangerous game
********************
********************
********************
I'm not going for penny moves on the contracts so it's not really dangerous. Just going for simple 10-15% moves over and over
********************
********************
********************
That‚Äôs what I do. Turned $1.8K into $16K then down to about $10K. Might want to just trade futures on a different platform now that the Emini micros for $SPY are available. No PDT. no Theta. 60/40 tax rule.
********************
********************
********************
I've been looking at e-minis and once I know enough about them, I'll start trading them over SPY
********************
********************
********************
Yeah I‚Äôve more or less done what OP wants to do this month 2k-20k on my options account (I have a 25k+ account I just won‚Äôt touch options there again) I made my insane gains this may holding over night period I did probably make 4K of that 18k profit using my 3 a week day trades I also sold spreads to close out when I felt the need to Anyway holding overnight is when the best gains are made 100% and then it‚Äôs all about feeling the market for a smart entry

You're absolutely right! I normally go for 10-15% profit on my scalps and do 5-10% stoploss. That drop on the chart, I ignored my rules and paid for it. I don't be doing that again

I find it very difficult to predict a short squeeze.. it‚Äôs good recognizing their potential. Like AAOI has had some on its way down. But a company can sustain a 40% short float for a long time.

********************
********************
********************
Just because something happened with one stock doesn't mean the same will happen with another. This has much more coverage since IPO than Tilray did. Different situations as well. People have been saying BYND is overvalued already, doubt they let this get over $125 anytime soon. Keep buying the calls and I'll keep buying the puts. If the street really wants to go long on this, they will dump it hard. They aren't going to let it squeeze to oblivion and ruin the stock like Tilray. 21 JUNE 60 puts, up 21% already, I'll let that cushion be my stop.

Summary of AMD Keynote Presentation: Ryzen 3000 series: Specs and price performance comparison - 9700k v 3700x Lisa Su states there is an IPC uplift of 15%. Given Intel's recent MDS mitigation performance drop, I think it will be neck and neck for IPC. Amd might be slightly ahead? may be my own bias thinking that. Navi: Will learn more on June 10th but there were a few things. GCN is being replaced with RDNA - This is significant and unexpected, but very, very good. Details New GPU is comparable to RTX 2070. This would look to be a midrange product (I hope), price unknown. Epyc: Intel isn't safe in the server segment either. Won't put most info in here because it was already known, but have a benchmark. Oh, it has been announced for Q3 for launch. OEM and partners: a lot of praising Lisa Su, from being happy about making money off the stock, to MSFT talking about product integration. I think they're very impressed with AMD. All in all, I think AMD shareholders will be very happy when the next trading day starts.

Maybe very short term (though not even sure about that one). $NOK makes a lot of money from China and Huawei will probably take a higher share of China if they're severely restricted. I would hope that tensions simmer and that Huawei is able to trade freely. There are only 3 companies in their industry, and the success relies more on the overall growth of 5g due to better tech than one company taking market share from the other. Having Huawei research helps $NOK and $ERIC develop better products long term imo

********************
The only reason not to short BYND is how insanely expensive shorting it is. Short interest is something like 44% of free-float right now so if you own a share there‚Äôs almost a 1-in-3 chance it doesn‚Äôt really exist. Currently the borrow rate for BYND is hovering between 50 and 70% depending on the broker. Shorting it is an inherently short-term proposition right now and there‚Äôs genuine potential for a short squeeze.
********************
********************
********************
Totally agree. 83% on IB. Higher % of the float shorted on BYND then on TLRY prior to their run up. Plus TLRY has 17m shares in their float whereas BYND only has 10m.
********************
********************
********************
Short interest is something like 44% of free-float right now so if you own a share there‚Äôs almost a 1-in-3 chance it doesn‚Äôt really exist. What
********************
********************
********************
Imagine there are 100 shares in a company. A short seller borrows 44 of them off their owners (or more likely, the brokers acting for their owners) and sells the borrowed shares on the open market. Now there are 144 shares of long position in a company that only has 100 shares.
********************
********************
********************
How do you imagine borrowing shares to sell them on the market makes for a new amount of shares appearing? There's 100 shares total. Bob, Joe, Jake own 40 of those 100. I tell my broker "Hey I want to sell 40 shares, but I don't have any." Broker says "Ok, I'll sell Bob, Joe, and Jake's 40 shares on the market to Joe Schmoe, but you have to buy back those 40 shares at some point". The total number of shares is always 100, it just gets moved around.
********************
********************
********************
Obviously there are only 100 actual shares. If your broker lends out your shares you still have a long position and your broker will show shares in your account. The point is that shorting increases the effective share supply.
********************
********************
********************
So those fictitious 40 extra shares that get sold by the shorter, to whom do they get sold to ?? The broker or ? Also, what happens if the guys owning the shares on loan start to sell them? How can they sell something they technically dont "have" ? Does the broker just pay them the salesprice and thus front the money ? If thats the case, can't that compound to a serious outlay for the broker, and what happens if they go bankrupt because of this?
********************
********************
********************
It's just like money and banks. If I have $100 which I put in a savings account that's a money supply of $100. If you go to the bank and borrow $90, I still have my $100 on deposit but you have $90 in cash so the money supply is $190. It's the same thing with shares, beyond issued 100 shares. Shortly thereafter I sell 40 shares that I don't have. The people owning those initial 100 still have them but now the other 40 shares are showing up in people's accounts too.
********************
********************
********************
The broker would most likely front the money in this case which is why they charge sellers rates to short depending on available shares. BYND is ~50% or more at some brokers. The risk is somewhat limited because if someone blows up their leveraged position their broker can liquidate that account if they can't come up with the cash (a margin call) and there are limits to the risks that can be taken by individuals which apply to shorts. Brokers carry insurance preventing everyone from losing their ass if they go bankrupt, but in practice they manage risk much better than active players in the market like investment banks.
********************
********************
********************
It's equivalent to new shares appearing in the same way bank loans and debt 'create' money. A bank may have $100 deposited and lend out $500 against that to various parties (in practice this is even more). If everyone runs to get their money from the bank this falls apart but in effect there are $600 in this "system", the depositor's $100 and the $500 borrowed. This all works as long as everyone isn't trying to pull money out and the borrowed money is backed by some asset and isn't demanded immediately. Shares can work the same way.
********************
********************
********************
How do you imagine borrowing shares to sell them on the market makes for a new amount of shares appearing? There's a new "notional" number of "shares" created by the contract the short seller enters into with their broker. The value of those "notional" "shares" floats with the bid-ask queue (and it's associated spread/volume). Due to the unlimited upside potential of a share price, short selling can wipe out a trader who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing. Short squeezes are fairly trivial to engineer for a big pool of money willing to do that. All you have to do is buy up a massive block of shares and refuse to trade them... wait for the short sellers to capitulate while buying put options at they go massively out of the money due to the squeeze... then you sell to the short sellers at 2x to 5x what you paid and then profit on the puts when the stock price collapses. It helps to know the population of short sellers are their entry points. It's unclear if that stuff gets sold by brokers with the typical order flow product that gets sold.
********************
********************
********************
From a high level broker perspective say one ownee owns 100 shares out of 100. The guy tries to buy more and a short seller is selling 40 borrowed shares....the guy who bought them will have 140 shares and the short seller will have -40 shares which equals a total of 100.
********************
********************
********************
Yeah but the short seller has -44 shares so there's still 100 lol. This sub is so fucking retarded sometimes that I can't tell who is a troll and who isn't.

It's not for vegetarians/vegans as much. I think it's a response to the environment, and how bad it is to raise cattle. Ass the fresh water and food and waste product that goes into each pound of meat is crazy and definitely not sustainable. So they're trying to make something everyone could love
********************

It's an over population issue; more people and more cattle will require more water, food, and land. In the battle between cows and humans, eventually the humans and gonna win.
********************
********************
********************
I think that war was won in 10000 BC. Until cows develop opposable thumbs and revolt. And I wouldn't be so sure of that. There are still mind boggling amounts of people in abject poverty in unclean conditions with a scarcity of food and water living on top of each other while we eat exotic food flown in from all over next day have a million options of exotic drinks and can own acres of pristine land in sanitized conditions. They'll be soilent green for the masses before people give up beef.

Going to inverse. Demand outstripping supply means they‚Äôre going to have nice cash flow. Plus I saw them at a local taco chain that competes against Chipotle called Chronic Tacos at two different locations in two different towns. Edit: So I was curious as to where their products are going if you can‚Äôt find them in stores and who else this company is selling to (other than grocery stores) and how much market penetration they have despite supply shortages in Canada like you mentioned. I came across this list and Chronic Tacos with their 51 outlets nationwide isn‚Äôt even on this list so they‚Äôll have to update it. But the list itself is impressive if theyre supplying these restaurants and grocery chains. Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt hold long enough to care one way or the other and I‚Äôll make money on a company, calls or puts. Here is the link if anyone is interested in what I‚Äôve found. https://www.livekindly.com/9-u-s-restaurant-chains-that-serve-the-vegan-beyond-burger/ Edit2: and these are just their burgers, not even the other alternatives like sausages
********************
********************
********************
There wasn‚Äôt even a spot in the shelf which means there was maybe 4 packages
********************
********************
********************
This doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt have it. When one product sells out then they‚Äôll put something else there to sell. The best thing to do is talk to those managers and ask them what the deal is. Availability could be an issue with a new product or a slow roll out. Could be any number of things.
********************
********************
********************
Imagine going to a store, jumping to conclusions after not seeing a product, and then merrily skipping out of said store thinking you've found some bombshell DD without even asking the managers any questions. You hate to see it.
********************
********************
********************
For all they know the truck could be late or broken down somewhere.
********************
********************
********************
The success was obvious to everyone else before the ipo, why wouldn't the company expect it too?
********************
********************
********************
It's 100% there. The problem it is not with other veggie burgers or meatless products like Yves, It's stored in the meat section because it's "fake meat" making it impossible to find. It's bad merchandising from the grocery stores not a distribution problem.
********************
********************
********************
In Toronto, I havent seen it or a section for it in my organic foodmarkets although I do know Sobey's & A&W have it (although sometimes sold out at A&W). I just hope the demand is at Sobeys. Plenty of non-BYND meatless meats Demand outstripping supply but there is a natural limit to how much they can charge for meatless meat. At some price point, meat eaters are going to go back to meat patties. They dont want their market share to be only vegetarians/vegans, they would go bankrupt.
********************
********************
********************
This guy couldn‚Äôt immediately find Beyond Meat burgers. Solid DD
********************
********************
********************
Extremely solid. When my kids wanted a fidget spinner, I couldn't find one anywhere and they were thriving. The second my kids didn't care about them, I could see them available everywhere and nobody was buying them. So buy stock now, and sell them the second you see their product in the shelves.
********************
********************
********************
As a buyer I found stocked in a special, visible vegan area in Whole Foods USA. Maybe it's a Canadian thing
********************
********************
********************
It‚Äôs always at Whole Foods. It was in a Pavilions yesterday which is owned by Safeway if I recall. Tho this is in LA which is pretty much a home market.
********************
********************
********************
It‚Äôs not a distribution network issue; demand is greater than supply. My local grocery store was sold out last week. Asked the manager to order some and in 2 days later they were restocked. They are also always in all the Whole Foods nearby. Your thesis is wrong
********************
********************
********************
A&W , try the breakfast sausage. Fuck, all this BYND hate is making me r/HailCorporate
********************
********************
********************
This is true. I went to safeway which is listed available. Nothing available there.
********************
********************
********************
They‚Äôre always in stock at Safeway and Whole Foods here in San Francisco. Philly too from the looks of it
********************

********************
********************
********************
I don‚Äôt think 4 stores really represent a large percentage of their supply chain. Every store near me has some available everyday. If they can‚Äôt keep up with demand, that‚Äôs a good problem. Lots of positive brand work with restaurant chains. Id be long but looking 1-2 years out.
********************

********************

********************
********************
********************
This is terrible DD and you should feel bad.
********************
********************
********************
This exact same thing happened for me too. ALL of the Vegan meat in Safeway is kept rightfully in the meat aisle. Beyond Burgers are NOT there. You have to go all the way to the other side of the store where the veggies and produce are, and that‚Äôs where I found the burgers after thinking Safeway was lying about carrying them. I‚Äôm a dedicated vegan who literally had to hunt within this store for some meat, why the fuck would a carnivore even want to put this much effort into some hippie shit? Goddamit BYND needs to buy proper shelf space. Gardein and that other brand occupy the whole meat cabinet.

Guys stop ripping him for futures and just ask hik where he thinks vix and corresponding volatility indicators are going. This fucker is right like 8/10 times. Yo where you seeing /VXM19 and vix going this week bud?
********************
********************
********************
Don't worry, I actually don't feel like I'm getting ripped on at all. I come for the options sinners. As far as /VXM19! holy.. that is a tough one, I will get on it and see what I can see in the "future" I'll need some time as I have not been watching /VX really! is that the one that is like $11,000 per contract? Yes it is!! Look at what TD charges you to trade /VX! haha It's like $13,000 plus per 1 contract to trade /VX.. I have not studied /VX but just from looking at it with my sense, I think it will go down. That means the market will slowly and boringly go up.. I "feel" /VX will go down. But let me watch it for a little bit and see how it moves in perspective to /ES /NQ and UVXY and Vix etc.. I will see what the future says about /VX.
********************
********************
********************
I don't actually trade /VX but I believe the 1 month and 2 month out /VX contracts are what VXX is calculated off of. The prospectus for the etf actually says it follows vix futures with near term 1-2 month weighted average expirations rather than following vix itself. Also explains why so many people get burned on vix etfs
********************
********************
********************
Interesting, I didn't read it and I should have. Go figure! I always say to just buy puts after great big upward swings, as Vix/Uvxy/Vxxb do the usual.. decay down since the market has to "continue" on up.. I actually currently have some $Uvxy $34 puts and I sold the $31/32 puts... Hoping that just nets me a quick $200-400 soon. I'm still experimenting with selling puts on Volatility, but I think the only way with volatility is to sell Iron Condors..

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt give in to the urge to trade during this crucial time.

Why would China agree to this, to help Trump? What would they get from this? Agree to something terrible, to help the guy who is fucking you, so he can then turn around and spend 4 more years fucking them? Agree to bad things, to help the guy doing bad things, on the promise he may ameliorate said bad things? The only thing more delusional than Trump, are the people who have delusions that Trump knows what he is doing. You people actually think other people are secretly in awe of Trump as you are, whereas everyone else is just sort of wondering why you people have obvious 'daddy Trump' issues.
********************
********************
********************
Don't be surprised if China wants to help Trump. Someone that can be so easily triggered is much easier to deal with than someone who uses his diplomats, military and back channels to work with the enemy. The Chinese might well think Trump is easy to deal with. And so may help him or want him to get reelected. Just because China seems to be in trouble with tariffs doesn't mean they aren't happy with it.

Correct. I'm sorry if I hurt your patriotism. Americans get hurt so easily. The point was just because on surface China looks to be suffering doesn't necessarily mean they don't want Trump to continue. Similar To what you said, you have no idea what sort of back chabnels China has been using :)

I could see the DNC making a deal with China to keep tariffs going until after 2020 to try and hurt Trump voters.

Are you being sarcastic? I feel like WSB is kind of trumpy, ‚Äúas if 4chan found a BT‚Äù. Whatever it is, it‚Äôs not really a tough call. Trump won because of swing voters in swing states. He has been saying basically the same types of things and has a great economy, and democrats are either politically similar to Clinton or further left. Those swing voters are going to stick to Trump because the DNC is doubling down instead of exploring alternatives.
********************

Lol do you read this sub at all? Everyone here thinks trump is an idiot. "Tariff man" not ring a bell? Have you not seen any of the gifs that hit the front page?

Automotive convenience stations (like those chains that are just a brand of gas station not a brand of oil/fuel) not only have a fair portion of the nation's car wash business, but are overall a good hedge position for most portfolios, and will do well in any economic situation that makes car washes do well (even in your example - if I only need to clean a little bit of bird shit off my car I'll be looking for a gas station with the squeegee window cleaner thing instead of trying to pay for a car wash at all)

I'm not on Snap. My point is it's in a similar position that fb was in back in the day, with getting them kids to use it. I don't see them pivoting to assholes(thanks, autocorrect) or adults like myself to continue growth. There's also no real moat there to prevent the next latest and greatest from siphoning off their user base. Fb, as much as I'm not a fan of theirs, at least has multiple platforms and revenue streams.
********************
********************
********************
The thing with Facebook is that yes, the kids have moved onto the next thing. Wanna know what that is? Instagram, and Facebook owns Instagram.
********************
********************
********************
Right. I'm talking platforms, not companies. I'm literally saying fb the company is poised to do well because they bought a bunch of other platforms. I'm also saying fb the platform is still going strong because they appealed beyond the kids. I don't see snap appealing to anyone else, and once the next platform comes out, the kids will move on to that. Snap will die.

********************
/u/CantedLight posted this great write up a little while ago https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2bov4/urban_trade_breakdowns_buffetts_1963_amex_yolo/ Crazy to see Buffet‚Äôs actual investment strategy beyond the folksy wisdom
********************
********************
********************
Buffet is the god of business. He has averaged 20% for the past 50+ years (an unbeaten track record to this day) and still has enormous success investing. There is no other single being that could stare down Chevron and get 10B 6% notes in one fell swoop. Mildly underperforming in long bull markets is irrelevant when you can buy up solid gold for pennies and outperform everyone else literally every other time. Buffet still has it and is only underperforming now because he has been preparing for the next crash instead of chasing ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù.
********************
********************
********************
i'd wager that he still has it when it comes to the sectors he's worked with his whole career but everything i've read and seen from him suggests that's he's completely out of touch when it comes to any kind of modern tech or emerging sector.
********************
********************
********************
I feel like what you said is actually the Achilles heels for a lot of young ppl/tech ppl tho (i.e silicon valley lmao). I mean look at Ark with tesla, they understand tesla's tech super well, but slaps a 4000 target on it, do you buy it? Everyone who thinks they understand just one sector of tech (in the gigantic world of tech) very well thinks it's the next big thing and puts a massive valuation on it. In reality, it's very hard to predict the next big thing
********************
********************
********************
I mean it's very posible to think you understand a sector really well without placing a ridiculous price target on it
********************
********************
********************
He‚Äôs 88. He‚Äôs not going to be naturally inclined towards modern tech. But he does know business and intuitively understands value to the consumer. He doesn‚Äôt invest in new tech or emerging markets as much as others because he doesn‚Äôt have to.

So I read the blog for a while and it seemed legit. (At least the few rants on hip hop seemed like Martin) also made a few bucks off some biotech tips. It also went dark for a while after the whole phone thing came to light. Any idea why it's down?
********************
********************
********************
It went dark as he switched to that freeshkreli blogspot site. When he switched back, the blog posts aligned. Feuerstein tried saying it wasn't his, but that shit was too autistic to be anyone else's. This one seems to have a higher odds of being permanent I would think. Has to be the Feds.

GTFO! How many trades are you placing per week/month? I‚Äôm doing (what I think is) a significant number of trades, and TDA won‚Äôt lower my commission below a dollar without a significant uptick in trade volume.
********************
********************
********************
I can‚Äôt give you a number off the top of my head but the guy said it was a lot. I had an excel spreadsheet where I logged all my trades but auto recovery didn‚Äôt do its job and 8 hours of my time when down the drain :( I‚Äôm also moving in some money into td for the first time since I cashed out all but 38 dollars from it after my 60 day promo ended LOL. Its not a lot (50-60k) compared to average td accounts (100k+) but it is still new as opposed to existing business. Lastly, I also want to point out that the guy I spoke with was like one year out of college. He might‚Äôve given me way too good of an offer. After all, I‚Äôd bet my left nut that he wasn‚Äôt supposed to tell me he had a playbook of fee schedules he is authorized to offer LOL.
********************
********************
********************
How many trades did you make last year approximately? You called in to them?
********************
********************
********************
Zero. I started trading on January 22nd. However, my activity in the time since is A LOT. I want to stress that I was RETARDED when I was starting out. It‚Äôs toned down a lot, but I would used to break off trades into pieces as it was commission free (I traded the 60 promo until it ended and on robinhood) as well as make impulse trades without much or any DD at all. I‚Äôve been gradually shifting to options though and I‚Äôd say at this point about 80-20 or even 90-10 options to stock trades ratio, so I specifically told the guy I don‚Äôt really care about bringing down the fees for stock in comparison to options fees. I didn‚Äôt bring up other brokerages and platforms to try to get them to lower fees, that‚Äôs not my style of negotiating personally. And yeah, I called them on the phone. Theyre also going to have a guy at my local td call me on Tuesday and set an appointment (hopefully the same day) to help me close my robinhood account and transfer over my balance and cover the fee. I‚Äôd told them that I was hoping I could start trading as early as possible but that robinhood was glitching and not letting me take out all my money at once, so I thought that was pretty neat too! (all my trades are settled but it‚Äôs only showing I have 2089.19 available to withdraw- and it‚Äôs definitely a glitch because I can withdraw that amount 5 times which is the daily limit on transactions)
********************
********************
********************
What is your total commissions paid year to date? It's the last item in the balances section of the app.
********************
********************
********************
Zero, I only traded on ToS until my 60 day promo ended (minus the $25 fee when I withdrew what I had in the account when the promo expired). I went back to trading on Robinhood exclusively but after the latest unexplained buy restriction as well as having to (once again...) sell options positions at breakeven/small loss rather than exercise and sell for profit (because Robinhood support has an eight day minimum turnaround) I decided I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the shitty customer support anymore. Even at the most conservative estimate, the restrictions, the shitty order execution, and the inability to exercise contracts cost me more than 15 times what the 5% margin and commission fee trades have.
********************
********************
********************
Cool, thanks and congrats, you REALLY lucked out on getting that commission schedule given your balance and history!
********************
********************
********************
Yeah, after seeing the response it definitely sounds like it. I think the major takeaway here is to always call during a holiday weekend so you can negotiate with the new guy üòÇ
********************
********************
********************
The 60 day promo also gave you free options trades? I thought it was only for stocks...?
********************
********************
********************
No that was stocks, starting out I didn‚Äôt touch options really at all. I got burned by some ubs outs and it took a few weeks before I bought any again, and i did it through robinhood. It was only stock trades through the promo. Sorry I didn‚Äôt really make it very clear.
********************
********************
********************
Gotcha, thanks for clarifying. I‚Äôve been wanting to switch to them for a long time, but I trade like a jackass so their commissions would destroy me. I‚Äôve seen people get good discounts, but never as good as you got! Thanks for posting this.
********************
********************
********************
Hey, if you trade like a jackass then maybe you should give switching a shot haha. I mean, that‚Äôs probably how I got the rates üòÇ

They basically stole money from me Friday. Had 5 .12 credit spreads that were otm. First notification I get is when I've suddenly bought them back.

You are getting $1 commissions?

I pay $4.95 per stock trade. For options, I pay $1 per contract, with no ticket charge. 45 cents per contract is outstanding, well done!
********************

I‚Äôm glad to know. I hope you can get yours lowered down ! :)
********************
********************
********************
Oh what the fuck. Time for me to give them a call again. Mine are at zero paper fees and .75 per contract each way. Edit: So your price is .45 round trip?
********************

********************
Yeah 0.45 round trip per contract. I‚Äôm a little worried a made a mistake and that it‚Äôs both tbh

People kept saying this would drop 2 weeks ago and then last week , I'm sure inverse is the best case here .
********************
********************
********************
2 weeks ago this was $66 and peaked at $90. Let me ask you. With a IPO trading nearly 300% over its IPO price do you think it is wise to be bullish? With ER in 2 weeks it'll be a rude awakening. Such a small float it can go down very quickly.
********************
********************
********************
I missed out on the day of IPO for 55, can't believe this has gone that high and stay up there . With ER we don't really know what to expect , if any good news about them expanding it's just going to drive this up . I haven't tried them yet but just the other day I went out with my wife to a fairly new and hip place , I was surprised to see they offer Beyond or Impossible as an option for extra $$$. I think a lot of people don't understand it's not about being vegan but newer generations doesn't want to eat meat as much , so as an " investor " this is something new and have a ton of growth. As for the ER if they do go down I'm sure it's going to get bought up , I highly doubt we'll see 25 range anytime soon unless something serious like a outbreak .
********************
********************
********************
You realize they are expected to report -.68 right...That is a massive loss for the company. Look at $PINS as an example. It dropped nearly 25% after ER that was reporting -.38
********************
********************
********************
You can't compare this to PINS , unless they report a bigger loss than expect everyone wants to see guidance here . I guess we'll really have to see what the market expect .

********************

I think the main argument against comparing them is that they're entirely different industries. Beyond hopes to take a significant slice of the meat industry whereas I'm not really sure where pinterest hopes to go.
********************
********************
********************
Apples to oranges. Not saying your wrong, but your comparative analysis is off. Pinterest and Beyond completely different animals.
********************
********************
********************
If a stock is expected to have an earnings of -68, and they report an earnings of -68, the stock should not go down...
********************
********************
********************
Fair but still as a first earnings that is not remotely positive.
********************
********************
********************
If company A is expected to post an eps of 200 and it posts and eps of 140, it will go down tremendously. If company B is expected to post an eps of -100 and posts a loss of -50, it will go up tremendously.

I was honestly thinking the same thing. Typical IPO runup, it'll fall back. Look at daily p/c ratio, options liquidity, as well as sir & buy/sell daily volume for a gauge but I'm going short it through june.
********************
********************
********************
Low float doesn't concern you?
********************
********************
********************
Definitely something to keep in mind, that's why i want to monitor activity. Options market liquidity is going to be terrible as well, huge spread but it'll beat the interest rates on borrowing shares to short. You really gotta nail the timing on this one otherwise you'll be banking on the big selloff. Probably best to go to fall expirations & selling near term puts to offset premium.

Will probably not happen. We just like to flex on them. In 2009, sanctions hurt the regime so bad there was almost a revolution (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Green_Movement). If there is regime change, it will come from the Iranians themselves. Because they are being squeezed so hard right now, Iran will especially not want to risk a war & destabilize the country/regime further.
********************
********************
********************
Iranian Green Movement The Iranian Green Movement (Persian: ÿ¨ŸÜÿ®ÿ¥ ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≤ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ‚Äé), also known as the Persian Awakening or Persian Spring by the western media, refers to a political movement that arose after the 2009 Iranian presidential election, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office. Green was initially used as the symbol of Mir Hossein Mousavi's campaign, but after the election it became the symbol of unity and hope for those asking for annulment of what they regarded as a fraudulent election. Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi are recognized as political leaders of the Green Movement. Hossein-Ali Montazeri was also mentioned as spiritual leader of the movement.Some have claimed that Green Movement protests were a major event in Iran's modern political history and observers claimed that protests were the largest since the Iranian Revolution of 1978‚Äì79.

Trump never broke a promise?? Wow, that is some next level autism even for a WSB post üòÇ
********************
********************
********************
not sure if you didnt read it correctly or you believe your own statement. i said he never made a promise that he did NOT break. he promised to bring the troops home but instead we've sent troops all over the fucking place. he promised to eliminate the national debt but instead increased it. he also promised to release his returns. he promised to eliminate AMT, he promised to block ATT/Time Warner merger, i could go on and on
********************
********************
********************
All in puts on reading comprehension.
********************
********************
********************
He never promised to eliminate the national debt, how can you eliminate 20T of debt. He never promised to release his tax returns. The AmT is pretty much eliminated. We pulled out of Iran deal, pulled out of Paris accord, pulled out of TPP, moved Israel embassy to Jerusalem, lowered taxes, eliminated Obamacare individual mandate.
********************
********************
********************
He did promise to eliminate the debt. He did say 8 years, so he has some time, but so far we've gone in the wrong direction https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lN6NtXJZEQ He did promise to release his returns: https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/donald-trump-i-will-release-tax-returns-607836227723 Amt is not eliminated any more than it was before he was in office. Taxes were lowered for the wealthy. Most returns i saw ended up paying more and clients were upset and confused
********************
********************
********************
There's really only two ways this goes down: 1 - Iran does something incredibly stupid (possible, but not probable) 2 - Israel forces the issue, with the Saudis jumping on board for good measure (this falls in the probable camp) If the later happens, I can see the US going into Syria again to reduce Russian counter retaliation.

Nope. It would only maybe happen if Trump is reelected. Second term is when presidents do all the retarded stuff cause they got nothing to lose then. Rhetoric against Iran is milquetoast anyways just routine saber rattling shit. Also Iran is 3 times the population of Iraq. If the Iraq War sucked imagine Iran.

True but theree was 9/11 and Obama bombing Libya Syria or Yemen with drones isn't quite like invading Iran. People voted against Hillary because she was painted as a warmonger. Not sure starting a huge war with Iran would fit Trump's MO.
********************
********************
********************
Yes but times r different. A war in the ME is very unpopular and would kill trumps reelection chances
********************
********************
********************
Iran is not a fake country held together by colonial borders like Modern Iraq is. Iran is/has been an evolution from Persia and the various empires that existed before it in the same geographical space. A war against Iran would be plausibly easier than the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq because it‚Äôs against a homogeneous opponent rather than an asymmetric and disunited opponent. At the very least, a US-Iranian conflict would look more similar to Israel-Palestinian conflicts in that the US could hit hard targets like Hospitals, Industry and CNC while minimizing civilian casualties by giving significant advanced warning of what it will destroy and Iran would have limited retaliatory measures as they don‚Äôt even have the technology North Korea has to deliver WMDs.

I made some paper buying NVAX puts after the RS when it was around 7. In spite of the >100% IV. Absolute dumpster fire of a stock. Bets are only on how fast it goes to zero now and I'd say the IV is rather reasonable, albeit limiting me from holding puts more than a week or 2.

Bull put spreads are almost irresistible.
********************
********************
********************
Diagonals, Calendars, or just short options all look insane. I'm trying to figure out wtf is going on though. The IV jump timing coincides with their earnings call: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/08/cara-therapeutics-inc-cara-q1-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx My guess is it's their no side effect opioid. There's not much volume or OI though.
********************
********************
********************
Pretty strong OI in the 6/21 20 calls and 12.5 puts.... not insane but definitely more than I‚Äôd expect. Something is clearly going on....
********************
********************
********************
Agreed but relatively nothing in any other expiration.
********************
********************
********************
My guess is it's their no side effect opioid. Sweet! It'll be 30 years before they find out that's BS. That'll make money for a few cycles

It's all fun and games until they take a 20%+ loss in one day/week.
********************
********************
********************
You make 10% in a week selling a $10 put. That‚Äôs nearly a 50% drop.
********************
********************
********************
This is perfect. Thank you so much!
********************
********************
********************
If you're looking for a stock around $10 that means you probably only have around $1000 to trade with. That will greatly limit your options for finding a good stock to trade as IV is only a fraction of the game. Now is not a great time to get into covered calls, since even though IV is high and you get a good premium, if Tariff man tweets and wipes off 5% in a day you're still going to be down money. Make sure the stock is one you would want to hold long term anyway, otherwise you're just asking for trouble during dips and corrections. I sell covered calls on AMD since it has ~2% weekly premium for ATM strikes. It trades in the upper 20's so you'd want like $3k. But given market uncertainty lately high volatility stocks will get hammered more by negative trade news.

Hey man this is WSB so inversing me will also be a good look; I would consider long-term call options for Suncor, Husky, Imperial, Exxon, Encana, Occidental and Chevron anything with Shale exposure, if you look at Canadian Oil firm's charts they are at all time lows (few things going for Canadian firms is BC's Supreme Court ruling & Trudeau being out of office in October) For example, Suncor's PE multiple last quarter was 16.63 compared to 2015 which was 402. The shale producers have become more like tech companies in how they operate their wells specially utilizing machine learning thus to improve efficiency and thus reducing operating expenses. I know it sounds bad here but Tesla for their renewable energy (Solar City) and battery play; but again this would be long term play. Rob West really helps put the energy demand in perspective, don't get distracted by what the second hand on the clock does, specially for Tesla there may never have been a better time to buy. These are not day trades but rather long term trades with a high probability of tendies again patience is keys, for this the demand spike in mid 2020 with serious concern of shortages. Edit: more clarification

Speaking privately, more than a dozen oil traders and refining executives in London, Geneva and Moscow said the cost may reach $1 billion. The estimates are based on the volume of oil contaminated and the $10-to-$20-a-barrel discounts refiners are asking to take the tainted barrels. The traders and executives spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting their commercial relationship with Russia. At the same time, Russian oil is taking a hit.

Not upvotes or karma, but posts/comments that are gilded have higher visibility than posts that aren't. So at +3 in 1 hour with platinum, his post would show up way higher than a post that's +20 in 1 hour with no platinum. It's not enough to overpower natural upvotes/downvotes, but since it's all about getting visibility it means the post can take off because visibility = upvotes

Hawaiian Airlines when you make 5-6 figure 0 day option bets but didnt want to pay for a mainline flight which would have Wifi so you can manage your position thru out the day. just WSB things even a 1st class AA/Delta/UA flight from the west coast to any of the Hawaiian islands would prob be only like 1.3k to 1.5k. it'll let ya board early or at a time convenient to you so you can finish the trade in peace as well. just really funny when you think of it that way. i know OP prob didnt plan to be trading on this day but he did open the position yesterday too while knowing he has somewhere to go. he estimated he lost out on 50-60k while a flight reschedule is prob pennies. hell prob cost less than $700 to book day-of 1st class flight to hawaii.
********************
********************
********************
It's not like Hawaiian is a second class airline. I'm back and forth to the mainland a few times a year and they're def preferable over AA/Delta/UA. (Alaska S-tier too) Most airlines just don't seem to do wifi over the Pacific.
********************
********************
********************
There's nothing wrong with Hawaiian I just feel its funny that OP has big bets requiring him to be nearby and he can easily just "save money" by canceling his flight and booking one with Wifi. All those mainline I mentioned has Wifi over pacific. They're not going to be blazing speed with great latency but at least he'd have some shot with managing those ORCL calls.
********************
********************

Or taking the next flight out

But it's more exciting and YOLO if he has to input the trade before takeoff on a non-wifi flight.

This should not matter. The wifi is satellite based.

There have been plenty of people that post a claim and say "ban me if I'm wrong." Those that survive receive glory, those that do not get what they deserve. Edit - although you have an 8 month old account, the 30 karma indicates that this is not a main account and you wouldn't care anyway.
********************

We all know he never said, "ban me if I'm wrong." OP is just spreading FUD and he hasn't bothered to show that he believes enough in his claim to spend any money.
********************
********************
********************
Does your DD mean enough to you that you have gone ahead and placed a bet on the outcome in terms of capital? If not, the next best thing is risking a ban. If you dont have skin in the game, there's no reason why anyone here should take you more seriously than analysts saying dumb shit on tv.

********************
********************
Oh don't worry, this will if it doesn't come true.

The fact that you're not confident enough to risk a ban over it, isn't really doing your prediction any favors

There is no truth. Yet. However the market will play out is purely speculation. We can only forecast based on our previous observations of our actions, which is why I think the market will go red on Tuesday. 40% chance it won‚Äôt

You are right in reading my post. The bottom line is I think the market will go down 1-2% on Tuesday. However bears and put holders will benefit from that is open to discussion.

I actually don't care, I just want to make money. ROKU chart clearly shows a solid history of gap downs after gap ups. If it doesn't happen this time, the thing is going to $150+ in a few months at this rate. It's like +5% per day rn. However, we also closed at top#2 of a potential double top today. Before ER you'd have probably said something like "just because it skyrocketed last time doesn't mean it will happen again". Unless you're a Roku fanboy. But it did pump up again on less of a beat. So it is just as likely to fall the same way it did last time, and any day now. What i'm saying is, either way you slice it you're going to get rich. It plowed through all the last red market days like nothing. If it keeps going up it's going to the moon, and if it goes down it's probably going down farther than it has in its entire history. Personally, with my luck, as soon as I buy a call or shares, it will go to $75 the next day. http://stocktwits.com/ITMSTRIKE/message/165442052 There could be another green candle, or history will repeat and there will be a longer red candle down even to the 60's. And there are a lot of 5/31 90c-105c right now. Like 12K volume, with zero volume below 90c. Way more than puts. So I dunno if you're a conspiracy theorist but...a lot of "them" stand to lose a lot less if Roku closes below $90 on Friday. Pick one and good luck.

I own a Shopify store and would say that this is a worthwhile company
********************
********************
********************
In my opinion, shopify is a great company with a great product. But everything has a price.
********************
********************
********************
And not every price has to be accurate
********************
********************
********************
This is a very dangerous statement.
********************
********************
********************
Roku is competitively priced. I can see them scaling up and taking a large portion of the market. Shopify is neato but a recession would fuck them up really bad as its small businesses customers all fold under. If they don't make a profit in this economy they won't make money when the econony starts go suck again. Both are probably a bit too overhyped and overpriced right now.
********************
********************
********************
They're trading at ridiculous multiples on a forward revenue that they're currently generating negative cash flow on...that is more than a tad overhyped.
********************
********************
********************
How does roku even make money? Hardware - but who needs a roku controller with a newer tv (or any smart tv) and The free tv channel - selling advertising on here. Are these revenue streams strong enough? I can‚Äôt see how. Anyone want to enlighten me?
********************
********************
********************
1 out of every 3 TVs sold had Roku as its smart tv software...
********************
********************
********************
That's the very reason it jumped and this guy completely ignores it.
********************
********************
********************
Moving from hw to sw based roku. Their sw is on about 33% of smart tvs being sold. Avg money a subsrcriber spends is increasing and user base is increasing. There was some rumours someone was going to buy them out which is why I bought early Jan and sold at 68. Could see them expanding internationally at which point I can see a sp of well over $100 if they expand internationally
********************
********************
********************
Fundamentally obviously they shouldn‚Äôt be priced at 10b. But I believe the market is looking at Netflix and imagining a scenario where roku can emulate netflix success albeit in a slightly different product. But basically any company with a strong potential story behind it gets more money thrown at it than a bachelor party at a strip club.

They don't make money. They lose millions per month.

they lose millions per month by gaap standards lmao. every analyst and hedge fund model backs out useless shit like sbc and depreciation. once those are backed out, roku prints money and will print even more retarded amounts of money with these rev growth numbers and margin suppression saying they don't make money is just straight up false. remember boys, NON-GAAP IS KING
********************
********************
********************
Doing a quick search roku is not cash flow positive and never have been and it‚Äôs not even close. It‚Äôs cash flow from ops is a measly 14 million with an M. And it‚Äôs capex is 18m last year.
********************
********************
********************
Yes, negative revenue is "straight up false". Keep pumping.
********************
********************
********************
the fuck does negative revenue mean LOL i'm not a pumper, i'm about to short roku but saying they don't make money is straight up false
********************
********************
********************
What the actual fuck are you on about? Their non-GAAP EPS was a measly $0.065 per share and their guidance for 2019 is a non-GAAP EPS of $0.045 per share...which means by non-GAAP standards they are expecting to breakeven on profit the next 2 Quaters.

There are lots of indicators. A good one is a sharp increase in unemployment from a previously very low unemployment rate. This is very reliable indicator. Can't let the peasants drive up wages too much. Economic reports are unreliable because they always do revisions to previous months once they have a bigger picture and it's all like 'oops we've been in recession for 6 months now!'

That's the thing that I see. It's difficult to separate the news from the noise. And, If I can be so lazy, if there was just a ratio or two to look at and I could set a google alert so I can just buy puts a couple months out, I'd be real happy. I don't want to buy puts and just end up bleeding theta because my signal was wrong/early.
********************
********************
********************
Yeah look at unemployment rate charts. When unemployment gets to around 2-3% and sharply increases recession quickly follows in a few months. Yeild inversions are good but if it just goes flat for a few days and uninverts its useless. Also yield curve can stay inverted for like 2 years until recession. Its reliable but useless for accurate timing.
********************
********************
********************
But everyone is reading the same news you are so it's all priced in. And if you're trading options the counter party you are trying to make money from is better-informed than just trading shares directly, since retail investors don't trade options widely.

Uh also the fact that it is in a god damn DUOPOLY with a 7 year backlog. How crazy is that and people want to bet against a company that has 2%+ dividend, a backlog longer than your trading career, and a PE ratio in the 20's? Yall are high. Choose another company, this one isnt PCG, it aint sears. You'll go broke fighting a company that literally does not have to compete much (if at all) for business.

I hate to say it, because ppl dieing should never be discounted. But think about what its like to be an Airline. Do I choose Airbus? or Boeing, well fuck me they both have ridiculous backlogs. If my fleet is already BA, i woudln't choose Airbus and increase my airline complexity. As much as we hate the Max 8, the specs on that plane is down right dirty. Itll save fuel by as much as 20-25%? crazy, it cruises at a higher speed? amazing. Its a spreadsheet decision, not an emotional one sadly. Thats just how the business world works.

You sound new to the sub. The same people have been saying the company is bad for years, while others have been bullish. Let me ask my favorite Tesla bull to illustrate: u/stockdealer Have I not always been, and probably will be for the foreseeable future, a major dissenter of Tesla?
********************
********************
********************
I haven't written that it would go down this much. However because it's a long-term play my primary concern at this point is to average down and buy more. Your panic is my profit. Just like I did with AMD when it hit $17 after rising to $33 which I sold off at. I'm not concerned about volatility as these are volatile stocks.
********************
********************
********************
I love you
********************
********************
********************
Love you too! Truthfully I figured it would be stable through the Trump recession, or even rising a bit and then recover but it looks like because it's more speculative that the Trump recession is going to hurt it. That's okay as there's lots of opportunity there in its multiple market segments. I'll be buying during the GOP dip. There's never been a Republican government in decades that hasn't ended in a recession.
********************
********************
********************
It's okay. If you remember, I said that Tesla would be bankrupt by the end of 2018 almost a year ago and was wrong, you called me out on it and I was far too pessimistic.

********************
********************
********************
But accurate, afaik. Their policies don't work as a general rule.
********************
********************
********************
The 2008 recession was because of sub prime mortgage bonds that were made possible by legislation under Clinton. It doesn't really matter who the bomb exploded under, more so who lit the bomb in the first place
********************
********************
********************
When the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate, it sent adjustable mortgage interest rates skyrocketing. As a result, home prices plummeted, and borrowers defaulted. That caused the 2007 banking crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the Great Recession. It created the worst recession since the Great Depression. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were government-sponsored enterprises that participated in the mortgage crisis. But did not really engage in subprime issuance. Another myth is that the Community Reinvestment Act created the crisis. That's because it pushed banks to lend more to poor neighborhoods. That was its mandate when it was created in 1977. But, the law did not require banks to make subprime loans. It didn't ask them to lower their lending standards. They did that to create additional profitable derivatives. In 1989, FIRREA strengthened the CRA by publicizing banks' lending records. It prohibited them from expanding if they didn't comply with CRA standards. In 1995, President Clinton called on regulators to strengthen the CRA even more. Some experts also blame mark to market accounting for the banks' problems. The rule forces banks to value their assets at current market conditions. First, banks raised the value of their mortgage-backed securities as housing costs skyrocketed. They then scrambled to increase the number of loans they made to maintain the balance between assets and liabilities. In their desperation to sell more mortgages, they eased up on credit requirements.They loaded up on subprime mortgages. There is zero evidence that Glass-Steagall caused the great recession. I'll leave you with this: "We can put light where there's darkness, and hope where there's despondency in this country. And part of it is working together as a nation to encourage folks to own their own home." President George W. Bush, Oct. 15, 2002

Put debit spreads. The IV is so high so that's what I'm doing. I try to write the lower priced put way OTM and wait for theta decay to eat away at it before trading it for something less OTM. I'm trying to roll the spread down and farther out once ITM and increasing the number of spreads. I have a few long puts, but I'm trying to avoid too many because I can be wiped out quick. I sold one credit spread and closed it within one day when I had 60% profit. Not a bad way to play.

Put is a contract that allows you to buy a stock at the strike price if it goes below the strike price. Call is a contract that allows you to buy a stock at the strike price if it goes above the strike price. This concludes your introduction to options. Bonus Course: Don't buy an option with low trading volume. It will be difficult to sell, and will most likely expire worthless.

********************
The first one I read was Options Trading (Idiot's Guide) by Ann Longue. It's a good book but I did not understand or more importantly respect what I read and proceeded to lose thousands. Since then I have read A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, A History of the United States in Five Crashes by Scott Nations, and The Big Short by Michael Lewis. I am currently reading Mastering the Market Cycle by Howard Marks. I would strongly recommend them all. I'm looking at The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks or The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham as my next finance read.

Doesnt seem like a bad idea. If the gut reaction people have, the impulse to buy or sell based on circumstances, is predictable and common across most people, then acting against it might be favorable in the long run since the market seems to prefer doing what we least expect it to do. Who knows though.

The reason you did what you did to lose 60k was taking advice, watching news, ect...

That trade has a limited shelf life. $27 absolute minimum and we're headed back to the $60s if trade war is called off and/or memory price rebound. Buy June 2020 $45 or $50 calls and sell 15 delta strangles while IV is high.

Agree, but surely a company that earned $12 a share last year and should actually grow from tech trends like autonomous vehicles, data centers, 5g should not fall far under $30 a share. Shitty retailers also have very low P/E's, but many of those are expecting to see their businesses shrink due to competition from e-retailers. The risks with Micron have always been trade war and pricing collapse, but pricing collapse would always be a temporary event. In 5 years time Micron is a binary bet on a trade war resolution that returns 300% if there is a good resolution and maybe loses 1/3 it's current stock price if the trade war becomes permanent. We'll have to see how hard Tariff Man digs in his heels on Gyna, but this could be a company that would benefit from a democratic win in 2020.

Playing options, as a speculator, is pure gambling it has much to do with luck. However it does provide a return that makes stock returns look like pennies. This is the market of volatility. There are multiple way to profit with option strategies that i will list below, but do realize these are not FD plays. When the market has sold off this much and you feel encouraged to buy or own the stock of something, take advantage of exploding IVs and sell puts. You will need cash as collateral for your trade but it is a good way owning things at cheap. If you, based on your analysis or feel confident that a company is undervalued and will go much higher from here and you do not have the money to buy many shares you can use options as a leverage tool, by buying deep ITM leaps where breakeven is 1%-5% range from the price you buy. This ensure least amount of intrinsic value and provides convexity. If you feel like closing an option position that you have made a lot of money on, you can sell calls/puts on it with more OTM strike thereby creating a spread. This locks most of your gains and also gives you more but limited upside potential. These are a few of my favorite strategies using options in current market environment. Good luck. YMMV
********************
********************
********************
take advantage of exploding IVs and sell puts Why specifically puts? What about writing calls? Is that ok?
********************
********************
********************
Because you‚Äôre selling puts, it‚Äôs like a buy limit order for the strike. If you get assigned, ok, that‚Äôs where you wanted to buy stock anyway and you pocket the premium. If it doesn‚Äôt go ITM, you just collect premium. Pretty much a win/win.
********************
********************
********************
I believe the idea is that the premium on the puts will be higher because markets are expecting a further downturn.
********************
********************
********************
Read the whole statement. He is saying don't buy calls if the stock is gonna pop. If you think stock is gonna fall then don't buy puts. All under assumption that the volatility is high.

Advice: Scalp trade during these times. It's also the other half of why the Church of Future Brethren have come of age again. Futures scalping or day trading options is the answer. But if you choose to play with disease filled decaying options, then it's about the timing of when you buy them, because computers are pricing in and black-magic formulas are making options worthless or too expensive before you even click to buy/sell with gay options.. So again, that's why you see me preaching the Gospel of the future, where there is no Decay, No PDT restriction, Trade at 3am, Trade on Sundays, and more.. You don't have to keep sinning, you can cleanse yourself of filthy and vile Implied Volatility. Step into the future WSB.

Try creating an indicator of news momentum. I don't care enough to actually do it, but here's what I'd do: choose a collection of tickers Scrape the results on seekingalpha, yahoofinance, whatever, for articles on each ticker. Once you have your collection, run sentiment analysis on each one to determine happy or saddy, then use your favorite comparison method to determine which news articles are repeats and which ones represent a unique new story By the end of Steps 1-3 you should have a collection of news events for each ticket you've chosen. You can use the earliest record of each news event as the date it happened Track stock price over the time period that each news event was released. Hypothesis = it's impossible to predict when the first news article is going to budge the stock, but stocks receiving a one-two or one-two-three punch combo (for good or for bad) will have sustained movement for the following weeks. I'd particularly pay attention to "two big news stories and a price movement of +/- X% in one week", and then seeing what happens in the following weeks. Big Media loves momentum. If two bad Tesla events happen, they're going to be scouring the Earth for a third.
********************
********************
********************
I've thought about that and have questioned how much time-period bias would play into that. Aggregate sentiment can be meaningful, but people's opinions and way of thinking can change during certain time periods that no longer have a statistical significance they way it may have once done. Maybe a dynamic model based on key people/organizations making noise would be interesting. First step would be to create a model that ranks and quantifies the certain the news source. Then do some data mining in to correlations. I wouldn't want to have to keep switching the sourcing variable, but i don't know how long and effective the data mining would be in order for this to be automatically dynamic. Unless I can get some of that AI to use, I'm kind of more interested in charting just to keep things relatively simple and consistent.

I have developed a meta-technical indicator that measures the number of TA posts per day here. When such number increases beyond a threshold we are said to be in a "high bullshitting market". Such markets tend to move sideways with medium-high volatility and as a result everyone can have their lines drawn on charts and claim that he predicted the market. You of course don't make money off this, just like with the rest of indicators.

I've been long Roku since 2017. It's been a ... wild ride. But I'm staying long. They reach an audience advertisers can't get to by traditional methods. It's not just cord cutters anymore. It's 18-35 year olds who have never had cable/satellite. And they're reaching that audience by the millions. Just from a user standpoint, Roku is the third largest "cable" company in the US. They've monetized their Roku channel. Streaming hours are through the roof. People just use the dang thing. And content creators want on their platform. But Roku needs to figure out how they are going to maintain that free channel with free content, supported by ads. Because content creators want their content on their own platform. So that's the weak spot. Wait, I forgot which sub I was in ... ROkU'S pRiMArY REvEnUE iS ROasTInG ShoRtS! GeT REkT!

********************
********************
********************
Shouldn't short this on my opinion. It is beating earnings and on the rise with many positive catalysts. Those that cite "it dropped after last positive ER" need to understand why. It dropped entirely due to a news article that said analysts see too much competition for Roku and question its valuation. This has already been invalidated because Roku is partnering with streamers, not being competition. It isn't going to drop much anymore, sentiment is too good. It'll see the normal dips a stock sees, but nothing like last time. I think this one will continue to rise.
********************
********************
********************
Im going to @ you in a couple weeks when the puts are up 1500%.
********************
********************
********************
Dont know the price movement necessary to di that but it's possible maybe. Like I said there may be a small technical pullback but ROKU isn't short worthy.
********************
********************
********************
I agree with you on the technical pullback aspect. I think roku is a positive in a sea of negatives and that's why it's getting all the buying attention. And long term with Amazon Netflix etc as competition I'm not sure if roku numbers will reflect growth. I've been bullish on roku but it's a very small player and can get crushed by the biggies
********************
********************
********************
Those that cite "it dropped after last positive ER" need to understand why. How about "it drops after every run up it has ever had". And Macquarie group has yet to speak up. Just wait. You forgot to mention that while they said some bad stuff about Roku after last ER, they also raised the PT by $10 at the same time. So to the point, the ER spike is not because the company is super awesome. It's because people want to make $ on an ER pump. As last ER proved, this current price is not sustainable. It's on the razor's edge. One whiff of and inkling of the slightest bad news and it's over. Down 20% easily. People don't care about the company, just keeping their ER profits.

Wall Street people are morons. They are in a commodity business. They have no IP.
********************
********************
********************
Other companies can definitely get in on the streaming TV OS game, but the optimization of the software is definitely important, and having a big userbase to draw information and data from already is huge. And they definitely do have IP. Not at Amazon or Netflix levels, but they've got good patents covering their hardware and software platforms generally, as well as methods for auctioning ad placements in networked video streams, for optimizing content listings to users based on behavior, for channel prioritization, instant replay, and content sharing.
********************
********************
********************
Their hardware is commodity arm SoC. Same as firetv that amazon could start giving away for free at any day. I don‚Äôt know a single person that uses a Roku, even my elderly parents are amazon. This is GoPro/Fitbit part two
********************
********************
********************
Except hardware isn't Roku's focus anymore - their smart TV OS is in 25-30% of all new TVs sold in the U.S. Their free Roku streaming channel is also present by default in the Samsung OS, which is the largest globally, meaning they can serve ads to a huge swath of the TV watching market. Then they get a cut of any subscriptions purchased through their platform, so anybody ordering HBO Now or Netflix through their Roku software gets monetized by Roku also. They're also collecting user data that will be monetizable in the future. Anyone that thinks they're just a shitty hardware business like the two you mentioned is retarded
********************
********************
********************
This guy got it. They start working with manufacturers to put roku in as a default app in most smart TVs, meaning they have close to no hardware development and support expenses now that they are shifting focus away from hardware. They are a data mining company that has widespread appeal in mainstream markets and no debt with relatively low cost of operation. The small hardware they still do sell is just a loss leader.
********************
********************

Their OS is linux bro. Wall Street said GoPro was a media company(wasnt) and Fitbit was an ecosystem(wasn‚Äôt). You saying Roku is a advertising company?

********************
********************
********************
That‚Äôs not how this works, that‚Äôs not how any of this works. Robinhood feeds all order flow to HFTs. HFT‚Äôs bypass best execution laws. If you‚Äôre trading more than $1000, you might as well pay a fee because an HFTs bid-ask spread will more than likely cost more.
********************
********************
********************
RH definitely has noticeably poor execution but how does a limit order not mitigate this fuckery?
********************
********************
********************
Mostly, and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably the best way to use Robinhood. There‚Äôs the possibility of latency where your limit order price was worse than market execution because of pricing lag, but that‚Äôs the risk of any online brokerage

I mean ok? What is wrong with the data they provide? I‚Äôve never had a problem using their apis, I admit that I wish they had a better UI, but what else is wrong?
********************
********************
********************
Saw the earlier post and I threw something together yesterday to collect option intra day data and here is the output https://www.dropbox.com/s/4a5v3c9mk7yqsq8/data.csv?dl=0 It is a CSV with the SPY 280,283,285,287,290 calls and puts for every expiration. Data contains Bid, Ask, Last trade, Implied volatility, Volume and Open interest. Maybe a bit more data than your package collects but maybe not as high quality data. https://imgur.com/a/hLDVowI Example of a contract plotted along with its IV.
********************
********************
********************
I like it. Are you just grabbing prices then connecting it to the underlying price and using that to backsolve the IV? I do similar elsewhere, but Python isn't really my thing and I cobbled this together pretty quick. If there's interest I plan to add something like that. Or are you grabbing the price + bid / ask and co live when it's happening and then the plan is to build out a dataset?
********************
********************
********************
No, the Implied volatility is live, i.e. its the actual implied volatility on the given contract. My plan right now is to build out a dataset for as many contracts as I can so that I can backtest strategies and research my own plays. Right now I am working on a "filing" system to efficiently store the data each day. Want it to work such that at the end of the day all data is exported to the main csv and if the contract doesn't yet exist in the main csv, to add new columns accordingly. It is very much a work in progress.
********************
********************
********************
Use a database and not some shitty handmade hacked together csv solution. Even sqlite will save you a bunch of time, though a dedicated time-series database would probably be the best.

Why is he announcing this to the world??? If this was about security concerns, then Huawei should never be part of a deal. If this was about the global 5G standards, then he should have kept his mouth shut and kept pressuring US allies to drop Huawei because of security concerns. He is discrediting US diplomats by basically admitting this was all part of the negociation tactics. I don't understand what the US gains out of this.
********************
********************
********************
Because he has the intelligence and maturity of a 6 year old.

********************
Why is he announcing this to the world??? Because he's the madman deal-maker and he loves to dab on his own administration to assert dominance. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46533971 China: what the shit you kidnapped the Huawei CEO's daughter right after Xi Jinping's meeting with Trump, fuck this arrest two Canadians in China for spying White House/State Department/Canada: er no this is a very legal procedure and uh Meng is in really legal shit for fraud and uh breaching Iran sanctions selling them HP shit Trump: guess what fuckers I declare she's a bargaining chip for the trade war Donald Trump says he could intervene in the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou if it helps to avoid a further decline in US relations with China. üòÇ
********************
********************
********************
Because he's a dumbass and abusing his power as usual while being able to act naive that he isn't doing anything wrong like he wants his trumptard supporter base to believe. It was never about national security interests, there's always a bigger picture with him and you can tell with his timing of his ban announcement. He's a gigantic orange baby and his followers are naive dogshit with him. Just facts.
********************
********************
********************
Trump supporters still think the trade war is actually about trade and not about shellacking China's ability to sink its tendrils deep into Europe's infrastructure. Europe is the USA's main staging ground for projecting power across the rest of the world and losing leverage over it to China is a big deal
********************
********************
********************
India is way more important
********************
********************
********************
These days India hates anything that isn't Hindu.
********************
********************
********************
The US signed the COMCASA last year. Arms sales from Russia have been halved while US arms sales to India have quadrupled thanks to sanctions. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon gearing up. Modi is not going to want to pull a Xi and right now they have way more to gain from the US than either China or Russia Enemy of my enemy something something...
********************
********************
********************
Modi has been surprisingly cosy with Xi since border tensions ended. India has much kore to gain by being a neutral party than to side with either. India wants to get access to US tech, but it definitely don't want to antagonize China while tensions with Pakistan are still there. India has also been engaging in trade tensions with the US and is one of the countries moat affected by the cut off of Iranian oil. Plus Made in India (no matter how disappointing the initiative has been) is directly contradictory to Trump's policies.
********************
********************
********************
There you go assuming a rational actor. Stop doing that. The trade war isn't about anything but whatever Trump feels it's about today.
********************
********************
********************
I'm assuming the treasury and state departments are the real drivers behind the trade conflict. Given the number of times Trump has made ridiculous statements that either went nowhere or were immediately contradicted and walked back by his administration, I don't think he is much more than a figurehead who runs his mouth on Twitter at this point. I'm convinced they do not even discuss strategy with him anymore because if anything he is an adversary to his own administration's longterm goals.
********************

********************
Europe is the USA's main staging groun The Chinese are stealing those euro bitches
********************
********************
********************
Its about intellectual property and FTT, as well as shellacking chinas economy in general keep them down.
********************
********************
********************
It's the presidents and the Senate's job to negotiate with foreign countries, and even chuck schumer agrees with Trump that we need to be tough on china. Given his support on both sides of the senate the president is well within his power to negotiate with china and offer pardons as a part of that deal. At this point you're blinded by TDS if you are against trumps trade war, because its a bipartisan issue. The fact you use the term orange is a strong indicator that you arent thinking rationally. The US is losing billions a year because of FTT and other abuses and we cannot allow china to get away with it any longer.

This is spot on, the ChinaMan government is putting massive restrictions on outflow of the Yuan.
********************
********************
********************
Is like hey I can see yuan is depreciating all the time let kill the USD does that make sense to you?
********************
********************
********************
If the Chinaman depreciates the Yuan, it negates the tariffs, meaning US buyers won't feel any difference at all and Chinaman people will have their purchasing power drop like a rock.
********************
********************
********************
To my understanding the deal was made that the US gets global reserve currency, in exchange the US protects trade routes and even gives other nations tariff free exports to the US (obviously they do not allow our stuff in duty free).
********************
********************
********************
It's called Brettonwoods and yeah that's how it worked. If the US loses the role as the reserve currency the world is in for a lot of hurt. The US will be fine because we aren't really dependent upon the world for stuff, but they are dependent upon us for the trade routes thing for example.

********************
********************
********************
This happens with literally every service, I bet you. Tools like SnapLion are an industry standard in the tech world, as companies need to be able to access user data for various legitimate purposes. Snap's "Spam and Abuse" team has access, according to one of the former employees, and a current employee suggested the tool is used to combat bullying or harassment on the platform by other users. An internal Snap email obtained by Motherboard says a department called "Customer Ops" has access to SnapLion. Security staff also have access, according to the current employee. The existence of this tool has not been previously reported. When so many people have access, there's bound to be some abuse at some point.

Because economy is still fairly strong, tariffs aren't THAT big of a deal (won't push us into a recession) and anyways people are still holding out hope of a deal. The level of fear isn't even close to 2008 yet
********************
********************
********************
And money is still cheap, Fed Put still in place, inflation is nonexistent, no where else in the world has the potential of the US market, etc.
********************
********************
********************
This. Millions of people aren't saddled with hundreds of thousands in debt, bagholding a house worth half the value they bought it at, like 2008. Yes, Millennials have massive student debt, but they also aren't as actively involved in moving the market because of this (though, their net worth overall is gradually improving). Most aren't trading stocks, they're just buying goods... the money in the market belongs primarily to Baby Boomers and Gen X. Both are overly skeptical because we have seen a crunch roughly every 10 year, 89, 00, 07, and are waiting for another. People are looking for a reason for the market to collapse, not focusing on the growth metrics. The "Trade War" has made people overlook low unemployment, rising wages, low inflation, and positive ERs... we're not in a boom, but this definitely isn't economic meltdown conditions.
********************
********************

Level of fear doesn‚Äôt rise in the general public until a recession hit the in the face - a recession is inbound no doubt in my mind. Republican administration will likely do whatever it takes to extend the inevitable until after the 2020 election.

********************
You really should sell your options in the morning when volitility is high. I'm sure you have woken up to your puts being up 20-40% a few times this past month. Gotta cash those out at open and make more in-and-out plays. You are holding options, not shares, there's theta. There have been plenty of profit taking opportunities for bears you need to take profits and roll out more short dated puts with a small percentage of your portfolio, the rest being in cash. Stop holding your volitile options for so long and sell them when they are green. Keep attacking in short bursts while building up cash for the next bull run, not trying to win it all on a crash. EEM and FXI puts have been my only bear plays aside from holding cash.
********************
********************
********************
You don't have to sell them. Just sell a vertical spreads against your option on any high volatility days. Then buy back it back if Cheeto man puts out some positive tweet. Sure it limit maximum gains but it will protect you from theta and will let you lock in gains.
********************
********************
********************
sell a vertical spreads against your option what's that mean bro?
********************
********************
********************
Btw you can still incur max loss on this spread and end up having to baghold until expiration because you can‚Äôt afford to close the short side of the trade (RH users since you can‚Äôt close a spread as one action)
********************
********************
********************
Yes, but you should be mitigating max loss with that short side. The general common sense rules to options still applies, this shouldnt be done with low volume options, don't over extend where you can't exit the trade and never with FDs (this technique). Short side should only be opened up for significant max loss mitigation. The OP is talk about expecting a large move down but up and down volatility was allowing theta to eat him alive. I'm assuming he's at least 30 days out. In this case a vert P spread would likely help mitigate.
********************
********************
********************
Because there is so much money on the sidelines and there are no alternatives other than the stock market to invest with interest rates so low.

No one wants to invest in shitty europe, or shitty india, or shitty china, or shitty south america right now. All the money is flowing into the marjet, theres no where else for it to go.

********************
********************
********************
You think Biden will win? I think Beto will. Biden is just too old. Beto will be able to energize the base. Boot-edge-ij will fade away since the press and he himself will make it more about him being gay than actual policies. That'll get the millennial vote, but older people would want actual policies, and not just vote cuz he ghey.

In a bear market, almost all stocks go down. What you want is a recession (a real one, not a WSB one). When it happens, adding money on a regular basis (like every paycheck) would let you pick up shares as they fall and then rise.

Vice stocks might be a good bet. They perform well in a recession don't they?
********************
********************
********************
Depends on the recession and what you define as a vice stock but mostly, no. The cigarette brands held up better, but the casinos got smoked. Some of the booze brands and defense brands were down basically as much as the market. It's less the vice stocks and more the consumer staples (which some of the vice stocks are) that tend to hold up better.

I normally don‚Äôt comment because I‚Äôm more interested in foreign policy than finance, but let me be clear with you all: this trade war will continue indefinitely. And if anyone actually thought we were going to reach a settlement with those jumpy fucks, they don‚Äôt understand the extent to which this trade war is driven by the national security interest. There is genuine concern in the beltway that the Chinese are already ahead of us, and it‚Äôs not far off. The current admin is doing shit job of handling it, but because le Cheeto has brass balls so massive that he walks kind of funny and probably makes noise when he runs, he‚Äôs not giving in to the Chinese. Bear in mind, a meaningful deal would include a legitimate mechanism capable of enforcing the terms agreed upon. To understand the significance of this, take note that agreements with the Chinese were made under both Bush(around 2004) and Obama, but due to an ineffective/no enforcement mechanism, both things died faster than an unwanted fetus. Things are now different because people woke up to a bunch of sneaky CCP fucks simultaneously trying to create a systemic competitor to the Pax Americana while also remaining incredibly reliant on economic success for social cohesion. The idea of a reasonably free market is antithetical to the CCP: if they had one, they would be vulnerable to outside political influence, and thus become democratic. For the past two decades, they‚Äôve been ass fucking us while we‚Äôve politely ignored them and taken their money.l Now, consider Bob fuckin‚Äô Lighthizer, the USTR. He is the one person that trump unequivocally listens to within the WH, and he‚Äôs been there since the beginning. He‚Äôs a mean motherfucker: in the 80‚Äôs, he once told Japanese trade negotiators his terms, and when they countered, he took HIS FUCKING TRANSLATOR MIC out of his ear and disassembled it in front of those poor bastards(they had 5 fucking recessions as a result of the policies implemented by Lighthizer). The CCP, however, is betting that Trump will be replaced in 2020. The success of their form of governance depends on it; in China, there is this notion that so long as you are making more than your parents, you shut the fuck up. The CCP itself has been effectively guaranteeing increased wages and growth, but they have done so through their own (decidedly non-market) system of economics. To give in to the US would be politically impossible; to do so if trump wins another term? It could start a war. TLDR: You‚Äôre all fucked but so is Huawei invest in Ericsson you fuck knuckled jackalopes

ITM options with a week+ to expiry are by definition not FDs.

********************
********************
I wouldn‚Äôt really say the risk of losing it all was really there, I thought the downside was probably limited to 6-8k if the market decides to turn a blind eye to the trade war like it has done before. With the volatility right now, I don‚Äôt really see a point in buying contracts really far out and I bought 5/31 because I felt 10 days gave me enough time to exit before time decay really kicked in. But there was no possibility of a big market rally in my opinion and the market was bound to react to the reality of a prolonged standoff. I thought it wouldve reacted more yesterday to the rumors about Hikvision, Megvii and etc being considered to be sanctioned, all the updated bearish analyst notes, as well as the reiteration of the patient approach on the FOMC minutes (and Bostick‚Äôs reiteration of it two days ago) but I guess it takes a little time for people to react. Plus, I honestly think it‚Äôs in both Xi and Trumps political interests to have a scapegoat/distraction right now.

Idk I do a lot of sentiment analysis on financial articles from a super wide array of sources to get a feel for general attitude towards the markets for any given day and this week has been largely very negative. While that doesn‚Äôt mean there is zero chance of a big rally it does mean it‚Äôs fairly unlikely in my experience but my guess is this dude isn‚Äôt a huge nerd like me With a home server cracking away 24/7 to get a feel for market sentiment so ya that‚Äôs a diagnosis indicator for sure!
********************
********************
********************
I do too, but through my own analysis since I don't have any programming experience. I am pretty goddamn thorough though, I read every single article that comes up on search engines, read every analyst report on the subject at hand that I can get for free (mostly through Mergent since I have free access through college + the very few you get from ToS and Robinhood), check the fed economic data, and most of all, I always keep mango man's twitter open and refreshed. Honestly, I even tread through the raw sewage that is Stocktwits and Seeking Alpha (and the 40 year old Cramer dickriders that populate the SA comment section..). Fucking hell, I feel like I lose more brain cells than a NFL running back reading what all those retards have to say but I have an almost compulsive need to be thorough... Although I'm probably no match for a computer, I can assure you that I'm not making blind, overconfident bets (at least, I don't think I am... but as I can only base it on my own perspective, that's not very useful in answering that question). I still have a ways to go in terms of fine tuning how I should interpret all this information (it took a few costly mistakes before I stopped applying my own logic to how others might behave), but I'm motivated to continue learning. By the way, I actually only started dabbling with trading at the start of the year, so do cut me a little slack in terms of knowledge gaps haha. Any pointers would also be much appreciated! Do you have any good, engaging CS resources you could share? I actually tried to learn python last summer but I couldn't find good resources that could keep me interested enough to continue; would really appreciate any good material you could shoot my way!

Your downside was around 15k not 6-8
********************
********************
********************
Strictly speaking, it was the entire $27 k I paid for the contracts. However, theta has been about -0.1 a day and I didn‚Äôt really feel like the risk of the market opening with spy at more than a dollar than previous close was really there. The trade drama is hanging over any good news that may happen overnight and there‚Äôs no dialogue going on at between us and China at all. That‚Äôs why I felt like the risk was 6-8k because I can exit and cut my losses if the market climbs during trading hours.

You have to read the prospectus and covenants. It's not clear how it converts.
********************
********************
********************
The conversion is somewhere around $760 (lol), so it's not going to convert. They're going to have to pay in cash. The main covenants are: no change of control covenant, you can't initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the company in the case of a default, and you're junior to any secured debt. Still will get more in the case of a BK than the big fat zero that equity holders will get https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1408356/000119312514371976/d800964ds3asr.htm

Yeah, cause tesla is a cashflow miracle with an easy year up ahead and they will have no trouble whatsoever to raise capital for this with their current ATH stock price. These bond holders are just giving away free money.
